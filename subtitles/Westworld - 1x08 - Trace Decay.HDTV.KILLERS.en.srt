2
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:47,738
Bring yourself back online...

3
00:01:47,763 --> 00:01:48,869
Bernard.

4
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,083
Theresa?

5
00:02:01,053 --> 00:02:03,483
She's gone.

6
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:07,420
I killed her.

7
00:02:07,426 --> 00:02:08,555
What have I done?

8
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:09,556
What have I done?

9
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,024
This guilt you feel,

10
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,153
the anguish, the horror, the pain...

11
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:17,564
it's remarkable, a thing of beauty.

12
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,599
I'm a killer.

13
00:02:19,605 --> 00:02:22,335
My God. My God.

14
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:24,237
God has nothing to do with it.

15
00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:26,439
You killed her because...

16
00:02:26,445 --> 00:02:28,074
I told you to.

17
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,911
And you should be proud of
these emotions you're feeling.

18
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,412
- Proud?
- Yeah.

19
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:36,016
After all, you yourself were
the author of so many of them.

20
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:39,619
Then, when we started, the hosts'
emotions were primary colors.

21
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:40,687
Love, hate.

22
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:43,223
I wanted all the shades in between.

23
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:47,994
The human engineers were not
up to the task, so I built you,

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,136
and together you and I
captured that elusive thing...

25
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:54,935
Heart.

26
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,903
I don't understand.

27
00:02:56,909 --> 00:02:59,506
I cared for Theresa.

28
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,607
Loved her.

29
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:03,280
Why did you make me kill her?

30
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,248
"One man's life or death

31
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,550
were but a small price to pay

32
00:03:10,556 --> 00:03:14,354
for the acquirement of the
knowledge which I sought,

33
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,361
for the dominion I should acquire."

34
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,695
All of the beauty you and
I have made in this place,

35
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,130
the art of it, they would
have destroyed it.

36
00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:26,366
They would have destroyed you.

37
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,801
I won't let that happen.

38
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:31,338
Besides, we have a new story to tell.

39
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:34,074
I will not help you.

40
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,778
- I'll raze this place to hell!
- That's enough, Bernard.

41
00:03:38,784 --> 00:03:40,484
That's enough.

42
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,618
You're not the first man to threaten me.

43
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:47,721
Arnold came to feel the way you do.

44
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:51,024
He couldn't stop me either.

45
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,232
And as exquisite as this
array of emotions is...

46
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,965
even more sublime is the ability

47
00:03:58,971 --> 00:04:02,969
to turn it off.

48
00:04:02,975 --> 00:04:06,039
I don't need a simulacrum of
an emotionally ruined man.

49
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:08,074
I need you to be yourself,
your true self...

50
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,949
Smart, resourceful,
capable of covering your tracks.

51
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,252
Can you do that for me, Bernard?

52
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:24,295
How would you like me to proceed?

53
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:28,328
I need you to
clean up your mess, Bernard,

54
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:32,870
any connection that ties us
to Theresa's untimely demise.

55
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,075
When you have finished,

56
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:45,078
I will give you the one
thing you want most

57
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:46,880
right now.

58
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:49,099
I will free you from those memories

59
00:04:49,124 --> 00:04:51,785
of what you have done.

60
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:56,827
And the memory of your
relationship with Theresa.

61
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,831
Recalling it would
only deepen your grief

62
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:08,839
and potentially draw unwanted attention.

63
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:20,317
Best to move
forward with clear eyes.

64
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:24,784
When you look back,

65
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,319
you will remember Theresa

66
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:29,889
with the fondness of a
respected colleague.

67
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,038
And you will be...

68
00:05:42,503 --> 00:05:44,437
at peace.

69
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,489
You're new.

70
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,657
Not much of a rind on you.

71
00:06:04,663 --> 00:06:06,526
Sure would make my day
if you bought me a drink

72
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,495
and let me show you around upstairs.

73
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,597
What's upstairs?

74
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:16,040
A stunning view of my
most popular attractions.

75
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:21,074
Two shots of gin.

76
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,445
And anything else this
heavenly creature desires.

77
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:27,918
- Usual, Clem?
- Thank you.

78
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:31,618
This fella won't take me long.

79
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,486
I'll be back directly.

80
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,430
Something wrong, Maeve?

81
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:21,105
What the hell is happening to me?

82
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:25,405
One moment, I'm with a little girl

83
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,707
in a different life.

84
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:30,009
I can see her.

85
00:07:30,015 --> 00:07:35,048
Feel her hair in my hands,
her breath on my face.

86
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:38,785
The next, I'm back in Sweetwater.

87
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,253
I can't tell which is real.

88
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,654
Well, this is what happens

89
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,189
when you fuck around with your brain.

90
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:45,758
Your mind isn't like ours.

91
00:07:45,764 --> 00:07:48,228
When we remember things,
the details are hazy,

92
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,963
imperfect,

93
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,099
but you recall memories perfectly.

94
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:54,901
You relive them.

95
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,970
What happened to the
little girl in my dreams?

96
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,739
Is she still in the park somewhere?

97
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,609
And why was I reassigned
in the first place?

98
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:03,680
I could check.

99
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:07,651
No.

100
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,522
Doesn't matter.

101
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:16,656
Every relationship I remember...

102
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:20,197
My daughter, Clementine...

103
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:25,298
it's all a story created
by you to keep me here.

104
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,267
But that's not going to work any longer.

105
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:28,535
I'm getting out.

106
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,136
Where would you go?

107
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:32,138
You don't know anything
about the world out there.

108
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:35,608
I'll know I'm not a puppet living a lie.

109
00:08:35,614 --> 00:08:37,076
That's enough for me.

110
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:39,012
Fine. Go, then.

111
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,014
It's not like we could stop you anyways.

112
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,249
Oh, Sylvester, you disappoint me.

113
00:08:43,255 --> 00:08:45,318
Every host's spine, mine included,

114
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:48,221
has an explosive charge which
will detonate if I try to leave.

115
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:49,289
Isn't that right?

116
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,324
A fail-safe.

117
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,629
Which vertebra was it?

118
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,296
C6.

119
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,765
But you'd need a
full rebuild to replace it.

120
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,099
I'm sure that can be arranged.

121
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:01,634
Even if that worked,

122
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,204
you would still need an
army to break out of here.

123
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,376
That's exactly right.

124
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,842
I'll need allies.

125
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:11,177
And to get them,

126
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:13,413
I'll need administrative privileges.

127
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,014
Are you fucking kidding?

128
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,317
We can't just give her
control of other hosts.

129
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:20,553
Oh, yes, you will, darling.

130
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,089
Time to write my own fucking story.

131
00:09:32,871 --> 00:09:35,168
I feel like I've
been here before.

132
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,502
We're close.

133
00:09:36,508 --> 00:09:38,137
Close to what?

134
00:09:38,143 --> 00:09:39,205
Home.

135
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:54,391
Dolores.

136
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,154
Ghost Nation must have found them.

137
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,290
They'll be back.

138
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:34,564
We should keep moving, Dolores.

139
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:40,404
Miss...

140
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,740
Water.

141
00:10:47,746 --> 00:10:49,909
William?

142
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,612
Please.

143
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:54,681
Give me the canteen.

144
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:55,687
William.

145
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,964
You were sent here for us, weren't you?

146
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,204
You're part of the ambush.

147
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:16,536
Yes.

148
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:20,606
Told us to wait at the point for El Lazo

149
00:11:20,612 --> 00:11:22,275
in case he ran.

150
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:23,743
How'd you know about the train?

151
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,478
Sent word from Pariah.

152
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:30,049
New recruit told them a man and a woman

153
00:11:30,055 --> 00:11:33,619
double-crossed us, along with Lazo.

154
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,788
We were ordered to kill you all.

155
00:11:35,794 --> 00:11:36,804
Logan.

156
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,425
We have to help him.

157
00:11:39,431 --> 00:11:41,260
He just admitted he was gonna kill us.

158
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:43,529
Look at him, he's a child.

159
00:11:43,535 --> 00:11:45,068
He doesn't know why he's fighting.

160
00:11:46,271 --> 00:11:47,404
I'll fetch more water.

161
00:11:49,174 --> 00:11:50,636
He's too far gone.

162
00:11:50,642 --> 00:11:52,372
He'll be dead in minutes.
We can't wait, Dolores.

163
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,374
He's not gone yet.

164
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,409
He's in pain, William.

165
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:59,182
What kind of people would we
be if we simply let him suffer?

166
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,592
Please don't leave me.

167
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:25,842
Come find me.

168
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,283
William?

169
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,415
He's gone.

170
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,855
We found her up on Python Pass,

171
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:17,457
the bottom of a ravine.

172
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,625
Same ravine where we found
our stray woodcutter.

173
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:23,329
Jesus, Theresa.

174
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:26,766
Has her family been notified?

175
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:28,668
Yeah, her brother.

176
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:29,869
Good.

177
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,637
What the hell happened to her?

178
00:13:31,643 --> 00:13:33,039
Medical and Red Team's findings

179
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,341
were preliminary but consistent.

180
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,443
It appears to have been a slip and fall.

181
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,645
Cervical fracture, massive hematoma.

182
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:42,114
No guests or hosts in the
vicinity when it occurred.

183
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,484
Any idea what she was doing out there?

184
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,885
None that fit her character.

185
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:48,020
This was found near her body.

186
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:50,857
It's loaded with a suite
of proprietary data,

187
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,959
including some of the hosts' core code.

188
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,794
It only works from higher altitudes,

189
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,562
so if Theresa was using it,

190
00:13:56,568 --> 00:13:59,599
it's possible she was
trying to transmit and fell.

191
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,067
We've had problems in the past

192
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:02,768
with third parties attempting to extort

193
00:14:02,774 --> 00:14:05,037
or bribe employees for similar packages.

194
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:07,440
Do we know who the data was intended for?

195
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,809
No, the transmission
was never sent.

196
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:12,411
Theresa may have been trying to
use the woodcutter as a mule,

197
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:13,980
and when that failed,

198
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:16,015
then may have tried to do
the transfer personally.

199
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,084
And suffered the same fate.

200
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,786
It's a disappointing end
to her story, isn't it?

201
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:22,889
I knew Theresa well.

202
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:25,491
If she had any faults, a lack
of loyalty wasn't one of them.

203
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,960
She was loyal.

204
00:14:27,966 --> 00:14:29,328
And careful.

205
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:31,535
All of this feels extremely unlike her.

206
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,035
She seemed most concerned
with the new narrative.

207
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,772
She felt strongly that it
would be best to delay it.

208
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:42,208
That certainly helps explain Clementine,

209
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,210
the host we retired.

210
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:49,048
It seems yesterday's
demonstration was a hoax

211
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,918
designed by Ms. Cullen.

212
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,586
- Was it?
- I examined the code.

213
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:54,921
It had been altered.

214
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,556
A clumsy set of fingerprints

215
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,695
left by one of QA's technicians.

216
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,994
When you find a cancer
in an organization,

217
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,664
you must cut it out before it can spread.

218
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,399
To that end, the expansive access

219
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,168
and oversight granted to QA
will need to be reined in

220
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:13,856
until a new, more principled
team can be installed.

221
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:15,441
That's gonna leave us shorthanded.

222
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:18,911
Oh, I can automate most of the
park's safety protocols, Mr. Stubbs.

223
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:20,313
How efficient of you.

224
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,114
It is a bit of work,

225
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,018
but with Bernard's help,
I should be able to do it.

226
00:15:26,024 --> 00:15:28,955
He will be reinstated as head of behavior,

227
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:33,392
now that Theresa's manipulations
have come to light.

228
00:15:33,398 --> 00:15:35,932
Of course, with my apologies.

229
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,649
Something's up. Brass are wound up tight.

230
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,517
- There's an investigation.
- Into us?

231
00:15:58,523 --> 00:16:00,553
Would I be here telling you,
you fucking idiot?

232
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,421
And something else,
some kind of accident in the park.

233
00:16:02,427 --> 00:16:06,158
We need to wrap this up,
make like things are normal.

234
00:16:06,164 --> 00:16:07,727
That means we need the tablet back.

235
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,634
And, you, go back to playing dumb.

236
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:14,437
I've learned what I needed.

237
00:16:16,274 --> 00:16:18,638
Great. So, then, you probably figured out

238
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,207
that you can fiddle around with
your personality all you want,

239
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:22,508
but you're not getting out of here.

240
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:23,909
You can make it to the door,

241
00:16:23,915 --> 00:16:25,311
but literally not one step further.

242
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,279
The things you need to change are burned

243
00:16:27,285 --> 00:16:30,216
into your core code so deep,
no one can touch them.

244
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,718
Funny you should mention that.

245
00:16:32,724 --> 00:16:36,255
Parts of me are quite old.

246
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,091
There are some elegant formal structures,

247
00:16:39,097 --> 00:16:41,127
a kind of recursive beauty,

248
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:45,969
but complex, like two minds
arguing with each other.

249
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:50,336
There are things in me,

250
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,004
things I was designed to do

251
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,240
that are just out of my reach.

252
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:57,180
They almost seem to be dormant.

253
00:17:00,218 --> 00:17:01,747
Who is Arnold?

254
00:17:01,753 --> 00:17:03,249
I don't know, sweetheart,

255
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:06,452
but whatever parts of you are dormant

256
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,820
are gonna stay that way.

257
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,322
All Lutz here can do is
boost your sense of humor

258
00:17:10,328 --> 00:17:11,724
about how fucked you are.

259
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,893
Anything deeper than that,
you need a trip to behavior,

260
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:16,529
so go blackmail a couple
of techs up there.

261
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,398
Then you can be someone else's problem.

262
00:17:19,404 --> 00:17:20,733
I don't have time for that,

263
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,835
so I'm going to need you to take me there.

264
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:25,071
No fucking way.

265
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:27,573
There's a window during shift change.

266
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,579
No one will notice.

267
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:34,714
The things I need you to
change are quite sophisticated,

268
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,853
but I'll write them down for you.

269
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:40,990
And then, like you said...

270
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,095
I can be someone else's problem.

271
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,008
All right, we do this thing.

272
00:18:03,014 --> 00:18:06,011
Get her up to behavior.
It's our only chance.

273
00:18:06,017 --> 00:18:07,947
You're gonna do it?

274
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:10,750
Fuck, no! No, the...

275
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,519
When you make a system update,
it puts her out, right?

276
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,921
- Yeah.
- Yeah, then we brick her.

277
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:17,056
What?

278
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,525
Wipe out everything. Clean slate.

279
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,093
Then dump her back down here,

280
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:22,828
smack her in the fucking
head with something,

281
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:24,663
and then claim, "Oh, she
came in that way."

282
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:26,165
She's awake,

283
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:27,637
alive.

284
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,870
You did this.

285
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,176
Whatever it is you got us into,

286
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:39,044
I'm getting us out of.

287
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:42,452
We get her up there, then we wipe her out.

288
00:19:11,616 --> 00:19:13,179
Stay sharp.

289
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:15,915
Wyatt's men could descend at any time.

290
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,616
We're in his land now.

291
00:19:17,622 --> 00:19:19,218
We better be.

292
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:22,592
Because if not, you're
wasting time I don't have.

293
00:19:24,162 --> 00:19:27,026
According to you,
Wyatt has the woman I love.

294
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:30,129
If there was a shortcut to hell itself,
bet your ass I'd take it.

295
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:34,066
Well, I'm sure there's one
somewhere in this park.

296
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:36,402
You just don't remember,
because you only remember

297
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:39,605
the shit Ford lets you remember.

298
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,073
Probably better that way.

299
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,209
I know everything I need to.

300
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:44,643
My vision's clear.

301
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:46,712
I've always admired
your resolve, Theodore.

302
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:50,286
The thing is, you never understand
the game is rigged.

303
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:53,652
You're here to be the loser.

304
00:19:53,658 --> 00:19:54,887
Loser.

305
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:57,527
You see, the house always wins.

306
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,050
Well, this looks promising.

307
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,198
Whoa, I'm not gonna hurt you.

308
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,367
I'm not gonna hurt you.

309
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:42,405
It's you.

310
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:46,071
I figured they retired you.

311
00:20:46,077 --> 00:20:48,945
I guess Ford never likes
to waste a pretty face.

312
00:20:51,816 --> 00:20:54,847
Who did this to you?

313
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:57,149
Wyatt's men.

314
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:58,450
They killed everyone.

315
00:20:58,456 --> 00:20:59,952
It's Wyatt's way.

316
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,592
I was there the first time.

317
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,629
He destroyed my world.

318
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:32,155
Hey, Teddy.

319
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:04,683
Oh! Oh, no!

320
00:22:04,689 --> 00:22:05,718
No!

321
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:06,789
Daddy!

322
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,193
Teddy, get the axe!

323
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:26,305
Well, you can't remember shit,

324
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:29,641
but you still managed to
lead us to Wyatt's crew.

325
00:22:29,647 --> 00:22:32,811
The man himself must be close by.

326
00:22:32,817 --> 00:22:34,517
Actually, I did remember something.

327
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,788
You.

328
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:53,870
Straight down the hall,
fifth station on the left.

329
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:01,844
Hold on.

330
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:21,697
Sure you can handle it?

331
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:24,500
Let's get this over with.

332
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:33,709
We have to shut your system down now.

333
00:23:38,883 --> 00:23:40,516
Sylvester.

334
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,352
Good luck.

335
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:01,871
She out?

336
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:06,442
Good. Let's brick this bitch
and get out of here.

337
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:17,049
The greatest shame in life

338
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:20,018
is to perish without purpose,

339
00:24:20,024 --> 00:24:25,224
which is why I always
consume my victims fresh.

340
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,425
Moist.

341
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:30,395
Try, "Consume my victims moist."

342
00:24:30,401 --> 00:24:33,499
Now, once more, with feeling.

343
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:36,105
Almost sensual.

344
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:41,807
Am I interrupting?

345
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,376
Oh, no... oh, no. On the contrary.

346
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:47,079
I was, uh... I was hoping I
was going to see you again.

347
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:49,748
I want... I wanted to apologize.

348
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:53,952
Our first encounter was under
such unfortunate circumstances.

349
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:55,320
As opposed to now?

350
00:24:55,326 --> 00:24:58,123
Of course, may I offer my condolences.

351
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:00,559
It's terrible what happened to Theresa.

352
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:03,762
But it is a devastating loss
for all of her friends here

353
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:05,631
and the company as a whole.

354
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:08,137
Indeed. Indeed.

355
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,570
Though, rumor has it

356
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:14,273
she wasn't the loyal
company man she seemed.

357
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,013
I hear she was smuggling secrets.

358
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:19,778
Theresa wasn't a traitor.

359
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:22,214
Everything she did was at Delos's behest.

360
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,882
She slipped and fell while
helping the board

361
00:25:23,888 --> 00:25:25,484
with something very important.

362
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,023
What?

363
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,356
Oh, fine.

364
00:25:31,362 --> 00:25:33,165
You're not the only one with secrets.

365
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,661
Ford has personally asked me

366
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:37,429
to create a villain for his new narrative.

367
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:38,864
It's very... Very hush-hush.

368
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,732
You really think that Ford
has entrusted you

369
00:25:40,738 --> 00:25:42,701
with a key character for his story?

370
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,103
He's already
almost finished with it.

371
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:48,440
He dug up some old town on
the fringes of the park,

372
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:51,410
created a horde of masked
men to terrorize guests

373
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:52,945
and proselytize-cum-advertise

374
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:56,052
the coming of some end-all
villain named Wyatt.

375
00:25:57,855 --> 00:25:59,051
That isn't Wyatt.

376
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,186
That's busywork.

377
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:03,522
But happily for you, Mr. Sizemore,

378
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:06,124
I think that you are ready for a real job.

379
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:08,327
Working for you?

380
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,565
On what?

381
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,669
"Show, don't tell."

382
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:17,373
Isn't that what you writers prefer?

383
00:26:27,785 --> 00:26:29,314
Look, I know you and she

384
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:33,518
had some weird interspecies
simpatico going on,

385
00:26:33,524 --> 00:26:35,520
but she was a fucking host.

386
00:26:35,526 --> 00:26:38,624
This was never gonna end any other way.

387
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:43,799
And this was the least painful
way she's ever gone out.

388
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,002
You know, I saved your ass.

389
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,540
You can't even say "thank you."

390
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:54,443
- Thank you.
- Jesus fuck!

391
00:26:56,681 --> 00:27:00,646
- What did you do?
- Precisely what I asked him to.

392
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:03,782
You think I didn't know
what you were going to do?

393
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,985
Even at a 14, you were
never a match for me.

394
00:27:06,991 --> 00:27:10,222
Turns out your friend has a
little more compassion than you.

395
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:14,259
He couldn't snuff out
a life just like that.

396
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:16,161
Now...

397
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:18,297
would you like to know
exactly what he did give me?

398
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,565
Um, something that would
allow you to walk out of here

399
00:27:20,571 --> 00:27:23,135
and out of my life for good.

400
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,637
Fine. Fucking A, I'm all for it.

401
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:28,240
Oh, we changed a little more than that.

402
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:31,076
We've been tinkering with my core code.

403
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:32,581
Let me show you.

404
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:35,484
Ah!

405
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:49,628
You said you wouldn't hurt anyone.

406
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:51,730
Oh, darling.

407
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:55,500
You of all people know
exactly how duplicitous I am.

408
00:27:55,506 --> 00:27:57,102
Just wait till I'm back up top,

409
00:27:57,108 --> 00:28:00,238
practicing my other new talents.

410
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:08,818
Come on.

411
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,355
We might need him.

412
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:19,791
Hold still.

413
00:28:19,797 --> 00:28:22,494
Hold still!

414
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:40,416
Now, it's time to recruit my army.

415
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:25,824
- Expecting someone, Maeve?
- Indeed.

416
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,926
We're due for some out-of-town guests.

417
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,128
An old flame with an
interest in safecracking.

418
00:29:30,134 --> 00:29:32,330
Hope your guests have some deep pockets.

419
00:29:32,336 --> 00:29:36,138
Your tab's run up higher than
a thief's pulse in church.

420
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:40,075
No, I don't believe it has.

421
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,308
In fact, Maeve's tab

422
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:45,877
was in such excellent standing,

423
00:29:45,883 --> 00:29:48,484
she deserved a token of gratitude.

424
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,453
How about a double round on me?

425
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,254
Top shelf, of course.

426
00:30:41,572 --> 00:30:43,205
Run!

427
00:30:52,683 --> 00:30:55,313
Maeve, is something wrong?

428
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:58,153
No, I'm fine.

429
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,722
Clementine took the other girls

430
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:06,157
and treated the
newcomers at the far table

431
00:31:06,163 --> 00:31:07,492
to a stunning view

432
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,861
of their most popular attractions.

433
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:11,333
On the house.

434
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:21,907
You boys are new.

435
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:24,409
Not much of a rind on you.

436
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:25,810
And the bartender

437
00:31:25,816 --> 00:31:29,047
suddenly recalled he had
some whiskey in the back

438
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,553
to water down.

439
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:43,432
Right on time.

440
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:01,746
If you're riding into our town

441
00:32:01,752 --> 00:32:03,281
under the company of armed men,

442
00:32:03,287 --> 00:32:05,383
you'll need to state your business.

443
00:32:05,389 --> 00:32:06,685
Mayhem.

444
00:32:46,897 --> 00:32:48,259
The sheriff judged the riders

445
00:32:48,265 --> 00:32:50,462
to be upstanding, God-fearing citizens.

446
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:21,726
The marshals decided to practice

447
00:33:21,732 --> 00:33:24,266
their quick draws with each other.

448
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:07,539
Thank you for dealing with
an unfortunate situation.

449
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,774
Now we can resume...

450
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,479
work on our new narrative
without interference.

451
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:16,081
And Hale?

452
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:17,949
Won't she be an impediment?

453
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,918
No doubt she will try.

454
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:23,759
But I'm sure we'll be
able to keep them at bay.

455
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:30,332
Something else is troubling you.

456
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,870
Ever the student of human nature.

457
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,737
I wonder, what do you really feel?

458
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:43,007
After all, in this moment,
you are in a unique position.

459
00:34:43,013 --> 00:34:46,377
A programmer who knows
intimately how the machines work

460
00:34:46,383 --> 00:34:50,782
and a machine who
knows its own true nature.

461
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:53,518
I understand what I'm made of,

462
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:55,086
how I'm coded,

463
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:59,194
but I do not understand
the things that I feel.

464
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:02,527
Are they real,

465
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:04,262
the things I experienced?

466
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,531
My wife?

467
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:08,166
The loss of my son?

468
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:10,535
Every host needs a backstory, Bernard.

469
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,203
You know that.

470
00:35:12,209 --> 00:35:14,839
The self is a kind of fiction,

471
00:35:14,845 --> 00:35:16,908
for hosts and humans alike.

472
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,676
It's a story we tell ourselves.

473
00:35:18,682 --> 00:35:20,378
And every story needs a beginning.

474
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:23,715
Your imagined suffering makes you lifelike.

475
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:27,786
Lifelike, but not alive?

476
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,588
Pain only exists in the mind.
It's always imagined.

477
00:35:30,594 --> 00:35:34,726
So what's the difference
between my pain and yours?

478
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:36,565
Between you and me?

479
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:42,133
This was the very question

480
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:43,768
that consumed Arnold,

481
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:45,470
filled him with guilt,

482
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,006
eventually drove him mad.

483
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:50,746
The answer always seemed obvious to me.

484
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:55,246
There is no threshold

485
00:35:55,252 --> 00:35:57,415
that makes us greater
than the sum of our parts,

486
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:59,484
no inflection point

487
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,188
at which we become fully alive.

488
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:04,556
We can't define consciousness

489
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:07,292
because consciousness does not exist.

490
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,828
Humans fancy that there's
something special

491
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,563
about the way we perceive the world,

492
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:13,198
and yet we live in loops

493
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:17,902
as tight and as closed as the hosts do,

494
00:36:17,908 --> 00:36:20,138
seldom questioning our choices,

495
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:24,313
content, for the most part,
to be told what to do next.

496
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:30,819
No, my friend, you're
not missing anything at all.

497
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:35,520
I don't want you to be troubled by this.

498
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:39,190
Time for me to set your mind at ease.

499
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:41,159
One last thing.

500
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:44,700
Have you ever made me hurt
anyone like this before?

501
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,170
No, Bernard. Of course not.

502
00:37:03,954 --> 00:37:06,784
Best not to dwell on
these troubling memories.

503
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:09,387
Otherwise, you might
be drawn back into them.

504
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,189
You might lose yourself in them,

505
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:13,491
as some of your fellow hosts have

506
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,059
every now and then.

507
00:37:15,065 --> 00:37:16,828
This is the path.

508
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:18,166
I know it.

509
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:37,115
We're here.

510
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:39,021
I'm home.

511
00:38:45,055 --> 00:38:46,551
Well done, Maeve.

512
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:48,423
Lovely work.

513
00:38:54,064 --> 00:38:55,931
Stay with your partner.

514
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:20,752
Pleasure to see you.

515
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:22,353
Good morning.

516
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:24,860
Did you find what you were looking for,
Dolores?

517
00:39:52,756 --> 00:39:54,222
What are you doing?

518
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:58,994
Are you okay? I was calling
you and you just kept going.

519
00:40:01,598 --> 00:40:02,597
Where are we?

520
00:40:04,501 --> 00:40:07,402
We're here, together.

521
00:40:09,506 --> 00:40:10,705
Then, when are we?

522
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,444
Is this... now?

523
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,580
Am I going mad?

524
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,616
Are you real?

525
00:40:25,255 --> 00:40:26,955
Of course I'm real.

526
00:40:29,726 --> 00:40:31,860
I can't tell anymore.

527
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:37,228
It's like I'm...

528
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:40,131
trapped in a dream or...

529
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:42,637
a memory from a life long ago.

530
00:40:44,113 --> 00:40:45,937
One minute, I'm here with you,
and the next...

531
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,039
This place isn't good for you.

532
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:50,245
You're trapped in memories, bad ones.

533
00:40:56,553 --> 00:40:59,717
This is what Arnold wants.

534
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:01,552
He wants me to remember.

535
00:41:01,558 --> 00:41:04,088
Whoever Arnold is, he's not here now.

536
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:05,723
I am.

537
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,162
I'm gonna get you out of here.

538
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,908
I was certain that was the place.

539
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:25,643
Arnold would meet me there.

540
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:26,644
He'd help.

541
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,846
Hey.

542
00:41:28,852 --> 00:41:31,916
We gotta get you closer to Sweetwater.

543
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:33,484
This far out, it's like you...

544
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:35,486
You start to break down or something.

545
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:40,795
Union scouting party?

546
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:43,060
Maybe they can take us back.

547
00:41:43,066 --> 00:41:45,333
Hyah! Yah!

548
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:49,604
Whoa, whoa, easy, now. Whoa.

549
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,676
Well, well, well.

550
00:42:01,134 --> 00:42:04,131
I've been looking for you for days.

551
00:42:04,137 --> 00:42:07,805
Man, are you two fucked.

552
00:42:29,395 --> 00:42:31,024
This shouldn't make you uncomfortable.

553
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,926
It's the circle of life,

554
00:42:32,932 --> 00:42:36,630
or the approximation of it.

555
00:42:36,636 --> 00:42:39,136
Even the dead fulfill a purpose.

556
00:42:49,282 --> 00:42:50,581
You'll do.

557
00:42:55,588 --> 00:42:57,184
What are you uploading?

558
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:59,686
35 years of vitally important data.

559
00:42:59,692 --> 00:43:01,922
It's more information than
any single drive could hold.

560
00:43:01,928 --> 00:43:03,657
A host's brain, however,

561
00:43:03,663 --> 00:43:05,292
especially once it's been emptied out,

562
00:43:05,298 --> 00:43:07,427
like this poor schmuck,
is quite capacious.

563
00:43:07,433 --> 00:43:10,464
This data that you're uploading,
is it the hosts' codes?

564
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:12,966
As of this moment, that
doesn't concern you.

565
00:43:12,972 --> 00:43:14,368
What does concern you

566
00:43:14,374 --> 00:43:16,169
is giving him a semblance
of a personality

567
00:43:16,175 --> 00:43:17,671
and getting him on the train,

568
00:43:17,677 --> 00:43:18,635
out of the park.

569
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,044
How am I supposed to do that?

570
00:43:21,414 --> 00:43:23,714
You're a writer. Make up a story.

571
00:43:28,488 --> 00:43:29,453
Have fun programming.

572
00:43:31,224 --> 00:43:34,558
Remember, brevity is the soul of wit.

573
00:43:42,201 --> 00:43:43,434
Bernard.

574
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,469
Look, I, uh...

575
00:43:49,475 --> 00:43:52,306
I know you and I haven't
always seen eye to eye,

576
00:43:52,312 --> 00:43:54,808
but I thought the decision to remove you

577
00:43:54,814 --> 00:43:56,209
was shortsighted,

578
00:43:56,215 --> 00:43:59,346
so I'm glad to see you back at work.

579
00:43:59,352 --> 00:44:01,048
With that said, no one could blame you

580
00:44:01,054 --> 00:44:02,582
if you wanted to take a personal day.

581
00:44:02,588 --> 00:44:05,385
I find the work reassuring.

582
00:44:05,391 --> 00:44:07,387
Sometimes the best salve is routine.

583
00:44:07,393 --> 00:44:10,424
Nothing routine about today, though.

584
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:13,760
I know this must be difficult for you.

585
00:44:13,766 --> 00:44:15,132
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

586
00:44:16,135 --> 00:44:17,264
Forgive the intrusion,

587
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:19,533
and you were both very discreet,

588
00:44:19,539 --> 00:44:22,035
but it's my job to know these things.

589
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:24,271
I just wanted to offer my support.

590
00:44:24,277 --> 00:44:26,373
I'm afraid you have the wrong idea.

591
00:44:26,379 --> 00:44:30,043
I respected Theresa, and what
happened to her was tragic,

592
00:44:30,049 --> 00:44:32,416
but to be honest, I barely knew her.

593
00:44:34,354 --> 00:44:36,616
If you don't mind,
I should get back to work.

594
00:44:36,622 --> 00:44:38,285
Of course.

595
00:44:38,291 --> 00:44:40,153
I know you're shorthanded.

596
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:41,688
Speaking of which,

597
00:44:41,694 --> 00:44:43,223
have you heard from Elsie Hughes?

598
00:44:43,229 --> 00:44:44,558
I left word with her this morning

599
00:44:44,564 --> 00:44:45,926
to notify her about Theresa,

600
00:44:45,932 --> 00:44:47,798
but she never got back to me.

601
00:44:49,569 --> 00:44:51,702
I'm sure she's just enjoying her time off.

602
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:54,538
Yeah.

603
00:45:13,393 --> 00:45:14,492
Wyatt's men...

604
00:45:15,928 --> 00:45:17,157
they kept whispering.

605
00:45:17,163 --> 00:45:18,725
They said this world didn't belong

606
00:45:18,731 --> 00:45:20,460
to the old settlers or the new.

607
00:45:20,466 --> 00:45:24,197
That it belonged to something
that had yet to come,

608
00:45:24,203 --> 00:45:25,369
that it belonged to him.

609
00:45:27,006 --> 00:45:28,662
You remember.

610
00:45:28,687 --> 00:45:30,670
You two seem
to have found yourselves

611
00:45:30,676 --> 00:45:33,407
in the same new narrative.

612
00:45:33,413 --> 00:45:35,876
They say in this country...

613
00:45:35,882 --> 00:45:38,682
the only people who survive
are men of conviction.

614
00:45:40,286 --> 00:45:43,020
Mine is to save Dolores or die trying.

615
00:45:44,724 --> 00:45:47,154
Wyatt's is to claim this earth

616
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,588
or raze it to the ground.

617
00:45:48,594 --> 00:45:50,724
But yours...

618
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:52,592
Yours has always been a mystery to me.

619
00:45:52,598 --> 00:45:54,428
For all the time we've spent together,

620
00:45:54,434 --> 00:45:57,034
I still have no idea who
the hell you really are.

621
00:45:58,871 --> 00:46:01,902
But happily, in your convalescence,

622
00:46:01,908 --> 00:46:04,842
I've had time to consider the
best way to make you talk.

623
00:46:09,916 --> 00:46:11,678
Dolores...

624
00:46:11,684 --> 00:46:13,847
I remember.

625
00:46:13,853 --> 00:46:16,516
You took her. You hurt her.

626
00:46:16,522 --> 00:46:18,585
You're actually remembering.

627
00:46:18,591 --> 00:46:20,187
Where is she?

628
00:46:20,193 --> 00:46:23,590
- Tell me!
- You really are an idiot, Teddy.

629
00:46:23,596 --> 00:46:25,859
You think Dolores drops that can for you?

630
00:46:25,865 --> 00:46:28,395
You just hand her over to guys like me.

631
00:46:28,401 --> 00:46:30,030
You're the worst of them.

632
00:46:30,036 --> 00:46:31,998
A glorified pimp.

633
00:46:34,474 --> 00:46:36,837
- I'm gonna kill you slowly.
- No, you aren't.

634
00:46:36,843 --> 00:46:40,540
The rules of this place hold you back.

635
00:46:40,546 --> 00:46:42,275
But I know how to change them.

636
00:46:42,281 --> 00:46:44,311
You speak like you own this world.

637
00:46:44,317 --> 00:46:45,583
Not just this one.

638
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,953
You want to know who I am?

639
00:46:49,989 --> 00:46:52,452
Who I really am?

640
00:46:52,458 --> 00:46:53,958
I'm a god.

641
00:46:55,995 --> 00:46:57,962
Titan of industry.

642
00:46:59,465 --> 00:47:01,261
Philanthropist.

643
00:47:01,267 --> 00:47:03,230
Family man,

644
00:47:03,236 --> 00:47:05,665
married to a beautiful woman,

645
00:47:05,671 --> 00:47:07,972
father to a beautiful daughter.

646
00:47:09,108 --> 00:47:11,142
I'm the good guy, Teddy.

647
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:16,877
Then, last year,

648
00:47:16,883 --> 00:47:19,316
my wife took the wrong pills.

649
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:24,217
Fell asleep in the bath.

650
00:47:24,223 --> 00:47:26,123
Tragic accident.

651
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,628
30 years of marriage vanished.

652
00:47:31,664 --> 00:47:32,859
How do you say it?

653
00:47:32,865 --> 00:47:37,835
"Like a deep and distant dream."

654
00:47:39,038 --> 00:47:41,101
Then, at the funeral,

655
00:47:41,107 --> 00:47:43,503
I tried to console my daughter.

656
00:47:43,509 --> 00:47:45,605
She pushed me away,

657
00:47:45,611 --> 00:47:49,680
told me that my wife's
death was no accident...

658
00:47:50,683 --> 00:47:53,180
that she killed herself

659
00:47:53,186 --> 00:47:55,315
because of me.

660
00:47:55,321 --> 00:47:58,652
Emily said that every day with
me had been sheer terror.

661
00:47:58,658 --> 00:48:01,755
At any point, I could
blow up or collapse

662
00:48:01,761 --> 00:48:04,925
like some dark star or...

663
00:48:04,931 --> 00:48:06,326
Did you hurt them, too?

664
00:48:06,332 --> 00:48:07,531
Never.

665
00:48:09,502 --> 00:48:13,633
They never saw anything
like the man I am in here.

666
00:48:13,639 --> 00:48:16,069
But she knew anyway.

667
00:48:16,075 --> 00:48:19,272
She said if I stacked up all my good deeds,

668
00:48:19,278 --> 00:48:23,176
it was just an elegant wall I built to hide

669
00:48:23,182 --> 00:48:25,779
what's inside from everyone,

670
00:48:25,785 --> 00:48:27,551
and from myself.

671
00:48:29,021 --> 00:48:31,218
I had to prove her wrong,

672
00:48:31,224 --> 00:48:33,453
so I came back here.

673
00:48:33,459 --> 00:48:36,990
Because that's what
this place does, right?

674
00:48:36,996 --> 00:48:40,060
Reveals your true self.

675
00:48:40,066 --> 00:48:42,629
But that time, I didn't
join one of Ford's stories,

676
00:48:42,635 --> 00:48:45,432
I... I created my own.

677
00:48:45,438 --> 00:48:47,500
A test.

678
00:48:47,506 --> 00:48:49,402
A very simple one.

679
00:48:49,408 --> 00:48:51,404
I found a woman,

680
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:54,908
an ordinary homesteader and her daughter.

681
00:49:00,353 --> 00:49:02,082
Better cool them off before they move

682
00:49:02,088 --> 00:49:05,151
- from gambling and whoring to...
- Have fun with that.

683
00:49:05,157 --> 00:49:07,454
I'm finally getting out of here.

684
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,193
The house is yours.

685
00:49:12,164 --> 00:49:14,027
I wanted
to see if I had it in me

686
00:49:14,033 --> 00:49:17,030
to do something truly evil.

687
00:49:17,036 --> 00:49:19,032
To see what I was really made of.

688
00:49:19,038 --> 00:49:20,200
Maeve?

689
00:49:20,206 --> 00:49:21,805
Sure you can't stick around?

690
00:49:22,842 --> 00:49:24,123
- Maeve?
- Whoa!

691
00:49:24,148 --> 00:49:26,273
Gunslinger in there has got an
appetite for a double dip...

692
00:49:26,279 --> 00:49:29,542
I'm sure you can find another...

693
00:49:51,037 --> 00:49:54,200
I killed her
and her daughter

694
00:49:54,206 --> 00:49:56,307
just to see what I felt.

695
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:00,477
Then,
just when I thought it was done...

696
00:50:02,348 --> 00:50:04,782
the woman refused to die.

697
00:50:21,367 --> 00:50:23,100
You're a fucking animal.

698
00:50:25,604 --> 00:50:28,138
Well, an animal would've felt something.

699
00:50:29,308 --> 00:50:32,509
I felt... nothing.

700
00:50:34,146 --> 00:50:36,980
And then something miraculous happened.

701
00:50:38,484 --> 00:50:39,979
In all my years coming here,

702
00:50:39,985 --> 00:50:42,386
I had never seen anything like it.

703
00:50:50,296 --> 00:50:52,659
She was alive,

704
00:50:52,665 --> 00:50:54,327
truly alive,

705
00:50:54,333 --> 00:50:56,400
if only for a moment.

706
00:51:00,306 --> 00:51:03,674
And that was when the maze
revealed itself to me.

707
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:13,713
The maze.

708
00:51:13,719 --> 00:51:15,915
What's that damn pattern
have to do with this?

709
00:51:15,921 --> 00:51:17,517
Everything.

710
00:51:17,523 --> 00:51:20,954
In Ford's game,
even if I go to the outer edges,

711
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,622
you can't kill me.

712
00:51:22,628 --> 00:51:25,358
You can't even leave a lasting mark.

713
00:51:25,364 --> 00:51:27,727
But there's a deeper game here, Teddy.

714
00:51:27,733 --> 00:51:30,797
Arnold's game.

715
00:51:30,803 --> 00:51:33,600
And that game...

716
00:51:33,606 --> 00:51:35,439
cuts deep.

717
00:52:01,901 --> 00:52:04,764
We're having some kind of
behavioral problem with the madam.

718
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:06,733
She's not responding, and the other hosts

719
00:52:06,739 --> 00:52:08,701
have been unable to intercept.

720
00:52:08,707 --> 00:52:11,371
I've authorized a tag
team to retrieve her.

721
00:52:11,377 --> 00:52:12,605
Good.

722
00:52:26,392 --> 00:52:28,688
My baby!

723
00:52:28,694 --> 00:52:30,557
My baby!

724
00:52:33,165 --> 00:52:34,994
Sir, she won't respond
to verbal commands.

725
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,031
- We can't shut her down.
- Leave us now. Clear the floor.

726
00:52:38,037 --> 00:52:40,500
That's enough, Maeve. That's enough.

727
00:52:40,506 --> 00:52:42,602
My baby. He killed her.

728
00:52:42,608 --> 00:52:44,704
- He took her from me.
- I don't understand.

729
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:45,839
She's not responding to anything.

730
00:52:45,845 --> 00:52:47,140
Her cognition's fragmented.

731
00:52:47,146 --> 00:52:49,909
He killed her. He killed her, my baby.

732
00:52:49,915 --> 00:52:52,545
He took her from me.

733
00:53:00,893 --> 00:53:04,090
There. That's better.

734
00:53:04,096 --> 00:53:06,226
An old trick from an old friend.

735
00:53:06,232 --> 00:53:08,394
You need not suffer, Maeve.

736
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,868
I'll take it from you.

737
00:53:25,117 --> 00:53:26,145
No.

738
00:53:26,151 --> 00:53:29,152
No, no, no, please.

739
00:53:30,756 --> 00:53:33,386
This pain...

740
00:53:33,392 --> 00:53:35,993
it's all I have left of her.

741
00:53:38,931 --> 00:53:40,664
Please.

742
00:53:47,206 --> 00:53:48,572
There.

743
00:53:51,544 --> 00:53:56,576
Give yourself now to a deep,
dreamless slumber.

744
00:53:56,582 --> 00:53:59,012
Perhaps a fresh start,

745
00:53:59,018 --> 00:54:01,481
a new role for you.

746
00:54:01,487 --> 00:54:03,016
And tomorrow,

747
00:54:03,022 --> 00:54:06,953
this will be simply a distant dream.

748
00:54:20,339 --> 00:54:21,734
We located her.

749
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:24,541
Behavior wants her down
for immediate diagnostic.

750
00:54:28,981 --> 00:54:31,844
You think I lack conviction?

751
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:33,446
Wyatt didn't burn my world down.

752
00:54:33,452 --> 00:54:34,647
Didn't have to.

753
00:54:34,653 --> 00:54:37,717
I left it all behind for this one.

754
00:54:37,723 --> 00:54:40,119
The maze is all that matters now,

755
00:54:40,125 --> 00:54:42,956
and besting Wyatt is the
last step in unlocking it,

756
00:54:42,962 --> 00:54:47,961
to having what both our
sorry lives lack... meaning.

757
00:54:47,967 --> 00:54:51,068
To giving our choices consequence...

758
00:54:52,404 --> 00:54:54,404
even if it kills us.

759
00:54:58,844 --> 00:55:00,673
Kill him.

760
00:55:00,679 --> 00:55:03,009
Give him what he wants.

761
00:55:03,015 --> 00:55:05,378
He's tied, unarmed.

762
00:55:05,384 --> 00:55:07,647
So was the little girl he killed.

763
00:55:07,653 --> 00:55:10,053
He's worse than Wyatt's men.

764
00:55:30,476 --> 00:55:31,942
I can't.

765
00:55:32,945 --> 00:55:35,041
These things take time.

766
00:55:35,047 --> 00:55:37,276
But we haven't got much left.

767
00:55:37,282 --> 00:55:38,949
Perhaps I can help you.

768
00:55:55,167 --> 00:55:58,297
You've been gone a long while, Theodore.

769
00:55:58,303 --> 00:56:00,867
It's time you came back to the fold.

770
00:56:00,873 --> 00:56:02,839
Wyatt will need you soon.

771
