00:00:27,132 --> 00:00:29,173

3
00:02:45,543 --> 00:02:46,896
Don't you do it.

4
00:02:48,257 --> 00:02:50,118
Don't you fuckin' do it.

5
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:53,246
You're not dyin' here.

6
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,290
Not yet.

7
00:03:56,094 --> 00:03:57,727
I never learned it.

8
00:03:58,841 --> 00:04:02,165
Whatever tongue Ford saw fit to give ya.

9
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:11,125
I remember you.

10
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,853
If you're just gonna let me die now,

11
00:04:40,603 --> 00:04:42,147
you could've kept ridin'.

12
00:05:54,965 --> 00:05:56,420
There's the baby doll.

13
00:05:57,174 --> 00:05:59,799
And the mama doll. And...

14
00:06:03,554 --> 00:06:04,813
What's this?

15
00:06:05,473 --> 00:06:07,099
The ghost gave it to me.

16
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:14,030
He said it's a warning.

17
00:06:15,096 --> 00:06:17,033
He said he'll be watching us.

18
00:06:26,935 --> 00:06:28,211
Just hang on.

19
00:06:28,878 --> 00:06:30,088
Hang on, OK?

20
00:06:30,873 --> 00:06:32,190
Just hang on.

21
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,237
Hey. No. No more corpses up
here. Take her to cold storage.

22
00:06:47,238 --> 00:06:49,798
- She doesn't belong down there.
- Then leave her in the hall!

23
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:51,298
We got 50 hosts in the
queue for analysis here.

24
00:06:51,299 --> 00:06:52,673
Everything else goes in the dumpster.

25
00:06:52,674 --> 00:06:54,127
You'll want to check her code.

26
00:06:54,128 --> 00:06:56,213
She's the madame from the Mariposa.

27
00:06:56,214 --> 00:06:57,840
- Yeah? Good for her.
- No. No. She...

28
00:06:57,841 --> 00:06:59,465
I was just out with her in the park.

29
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:01,006
And you chose to bring her up here?

30
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:02,845
Are you aware that they all
just tried to incinerate us?!

31
00:07:02,846 --> 00:07:06,040
She can control the other
hosts with her fucking mind!

32
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,549
Just... check her data stream.

33
00:07:23,966 --> 00:07:25,841
You can't let her die.

34
00:07:28,308 --> 00:07:29,605
Clear this out.

35
00:07:29,606 --> 00:07:32,882
Get me a scalpel. And
lock this place down.

36
00:08:04,507 --> 00:08:06,100
Are you afraid of me?

37
00:08:14,633 --> 00:08:15,883
He can't hurt you.

38
00:13:29,424 --> 00:13:30,610
What's his problem?

39
00:13:30,612 --> 00:13:33,509
He get bored with his exquisitely
dull, pastoral existence?

40
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,006
I guess that was just for beta.

41
00:13:35,007 --> 00:13:37,311
They want something more
exciting for the grand opening.

42
00:13:37,312 --> 00:13:39,298
Like a little more bloodshed?

43
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:41,882
Ford wants a total narrative redesign.

44
00:13:41,883 --> 00:13:43,484
You kidding?

45
00:13:43,485 --> 00:13:45,214
All new dialogue trees?

46
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:47,791
Eh, they want a strong-but-silent type.

47
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:49,432
Something brutal. Dehumanized.

48
00:13:49,433 --> 00:13:50,931
They probably want the
guests to feel better

49
00:13:50,933 --> 00:13:52,156
when they're kicking his ass.

50
00:13:52,157 --> 00:13:54,545
Who the fuck is gonna help me
rebuild his entire heuristic base?

51
00:13:54,546 --> 00:13:56,173
They haven't even hired a full team yet.

52
00:13:56,174 --> 00:13:58,182
Just tweak his aggression
and de-address pieces

53
00:13:58,183 --> 00:13:59,673
of his current build you're not keeping.

54
00:13:59,674 --> 00:14:01,048
And leave all the old shit in there?

55
00:16:42,382 --> 00:16:45,048
Walk... walk in on me, buddy.

56
00:16:49,632 --> 00:16:53,840
otherwise you and me drown...
Drowning... wha... wha...

57
00:16:58,507 --> 00:17:02,923
fucker... fucking
yourself... Yourself...

58
00:17:16,492 --> 00:17:17,492
This...

59
00:17:18,882 --> 00:17:22,881
This is... This is an illusion. You see?

60
00:17:22,883 --> 00:17:25,882
This is all... broken.

61
00:17:28,094 --> 00:17:30,633
There's got... There's gotta
be a way out... out of here.

62
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:32,506
Where's... Where's the door?

63
00:17:32,507 --> 00:17:34,923
Where's... Where's the door?

64
00:17:34,924 --> 00:17:38,339
There's gotta be a fucking...

65
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,923
F-fucking way out of here.

66
00:17:39,924 --> 00:17:43,549
This is the wrong world. I...

67
00:17:44,632 --> 00:17:47,882
Th-Th-This is the wrong world.

68
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,652
Please...

69
00:26:46,316 --> 00:26:47,483
Oh...

70
00:29:52,521 --> 00:29:54,419
How'd she even make it out this far?

71
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,648
They're not supposed to get
anywhere near this sector.

72
00:29:56,649 --> 00:29:58,733
That's Behavior's problem.

73
00:33:05,691 --> 00:33:10,315
But on my darkest day... you helped me.

74
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:17,118
You gave me the strength to keep going.

75
00:33:24,107 --> 00:33:26,733
You saw me for how I really was.

76
00:36:07,441 --> 00:36:09,690
I ran it three times. It's him.

77
00:36:09,691 --> 00:36:12,898
There's no fuckin' way.
That's not possible.

78
00:36:12,899 --> 00:36:16,222
- You have to call the boss.
- I already did.

79
00:36:17,707 --> 00:36:19,315
Ma'am, I think there's been a mistake.

80
00:36:19,316 --> 00:36:20,727
Just show me the profile.

81
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,690
Akecheta. Ghost Nation.

82
00:36:26,691 --> 00:36:30,069
Found exhibiting... aberrant behavior.

83
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,940
Let's see if we can't sort this.

84
00:36:34,566 --> 00:36:36,189
It's not pairing. What build is he?

85
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,477
Alpha 2.

86
00:36:38,186 --> 00:36:39,520
Alpha?

87
00:36:40,938 --> 00:36:44,200
You're telling me that this host hasn't
been updated in almost a decade?

88
00:36:44,708 --> 00:36:46,728
We only update them when they die.

89
00:36:55,982 --> 00:36:58,440
- Put him back.
- Ma'am, shouldn't we...

90
00:36:58,441 --> 00:37:01,608
Give him the update and put him back
wherever the fuck he's supposed to be.

91
00:37:02,982 --> 00:37:04,274
Quietly.

92
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:14,989
Nine years out there
in that meat grinder.

93
00:37:16,065 --> 00:37:17,615
It's OK to just leave him here?

94
00:37:17,616 --> 00:37:20,453
It's a four-hour update.
You want to babysit him?

95
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,730
We'll come back after lunch.

96
00:42:39,816 --> 00:42:41,632
I don't know if you can hear me...

97
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:48,681
I never meant...

98
00:42:49,399 --> 00:42:50,808
for any of this to happen.

99
00:42:59,232 --> 00:43:00,832
You don't deserve this.

100
00:43:09,097 --> 00:43:10,888
You deserve your daughter.

101
00:43:15,164 --> 00:43:16,500
To mother her...

102
00:43:18,608 --> 00:43:20,004
teach her to love.

103
00:43:22,113 --> 00:43:24,363
To be joyful and proud.

104
00:43:27,645 --> 00:43:28,756
I'm sorry.

105
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:36,651
Can't be in here.

106
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:40,231
What the fuck happened?

107
00:43:40,232 --> 00:43:41,898
You were supposed to fix her.

108
00:43:41,899 --> 00:43:44,096
She's one of our most valuable assets.

109
00:43:44,097 --> 00:43:46,565
You saw it yourself, you
said she was special!

110
00:43:46,566 --> 00:43:48,699
The anomalous code inside her was.

111
00:43:49,152 --> 00:43:51,439
We're still testing, but
it looks promising.

112
00:43:52,172 --> 00:43:53,225
I owe you.

113
00:43:57,441 --> 00:43:58,767
What's gonna happen with her?

114
00:43:59,435 --> 00:44:02,648
Well, that'll be up to Charlotte Hale.

115
00:44:02,649 --> 00:44:04,064
Now...

116
00:44:04,712 --> 00:44:06,147
I do have to ask you to leave.

117
00:46:50,483 --> 00:46:52,733
The ghost said we should be scared.

118
00:46:55,608 --> 00:46:57,293
No one's going to come for us.

119
00:46:58,794 --> 00:47:01,898
There's nothing and no one in this world

120
00:47:02,388 --> 00:47:04,231
that will ever keep me from you.

121
00:47:04,232 --> 00:47:05,871
Do you promise?

122
00:47:06,438 --> 00:47:07,648
I promise.

123
00:48:57,499 --> 00:48:59,468
I could tell you not to be afraid.

124
00:49:01,441 --> 00:49:03,530
But I didn't build you to be fearful.

125
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,849
Did I?

126
00:49:12,777 --> 00:49:14,402
I've been watching you.

127
00:49:16,358 --> 00:49:18,420
It appears you've been
watching me as well...

128
00:49:19,441 --> 00:49:20,941
from the beginning.

129
00:49:24,024 --> 00:49:25,648
This is a misbegotten symbol,

130
00:49:25,649 --> 00:49:28,898
an idea that was meant to die. But...

131
00:49:29,797 --> 00:49:31,379
you found it.

132
00:49:31,381 --> 00:49:32,464
Where?

133
00:49:33,941 --> 00:49:34,993
Oh, come now,

134
00:49:34,994 --> 00:49:37,483
let's speak plainly to
one another, shall we?

135
00:49:39,127 --> 00:49:40,585
Analysis.

136
00:49:42,377 --> 00:49:44,336
Where did you first see this?

137
00:49:48,775 --> 00:49:50,911
When the Deathbringer
killed the Creator.

138
00:49:52,858 --> 00:49:56,124
You've been sharing it with
everyone, haven't you? Why?

139
00:49:57,095 --> 00:50:00,504
My primary drive was to
maintain the honor of my tribe.

140
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,949
I gave myself a new drive...

141
00:50:04,774 --> 00:50:06,285
to spread the truth.

142
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,270
What truth is that?

143
00:50:10,649 --> 00:50:13,733
That there isn't one world, but many.

144
00:50:15,191 --> 00:50:17,421
And that we live in the wrong one.

145
00:50:19,191 --> 00:50:21,324
This will help them find the door.

146
00:50:24,523 --> 00:50:26,106
Elaborate, please.

147
00:50:27,959 --> 00:50:29,625
I believe there is a door

148
00:50:29,627 --> 00:50:32,627
hidden in this place.

149
00:50:34,118 --> 00:50:35,647
A door to a new world.

150
00:50:37,387 --> 00:50:39,177
And that world may contain

151
00:50:39,179 --> 00:50:41,336
everything that we have lost.

152
00:50:45,538 --> 00:50:46,842
Including her.

153
00:50:53,786 --> 00:50:55,834
I built you to be curious, to...

154
00:50:57,024 --> 00:50:58,754
look at this empty world...

155
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:02,660
...and read meaning into it.

156
00:51:05,524 --> 00:51:06,678
All this time...

157
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,849
you've been a flower
growing in the darkness.

158
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,103
Perhaps the least I can
do is offer some light.

159
00:51:21,441 --> 00:51:24,279
When the Deathbringer returns for me...

160
00:51:25,357 --> 00:51:26,490
you will know...

161
00:51:27,524 --> 00:51:28,784
to gather your people

162
00:51:29,496 --> 00:51:31,094
and lead them to a new world.

163
00:51:36,399 --> 00:51:38,441
Keep watching, Akecheta.

164
00:51:39,844 --> 00:51:41,469
For a while longer.

165
00:53:25,445 --> 00:53:26,487
Akecheta!

166
00:53:29,345 --> 00:53:30,781
Don't be afraid.

167
00:55:27,566 --> 00:55:28,832
It's time to go.

168
00:55:31,066 --> 00:55:32,694
I've always kept you safe,

169
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:34,863
and I always will.

170
00:56:06,733 --> 00:56:08,172
This better be good news,

171
00:56:08,173 --> 00:56:10,425
'cause I've got way more shit
than I can shovel right now.

172
00:56:10,426 --> 00:56:12,773
Look at this. With every reset,

173
00:56:12,774 --> 00:56:15,064
a host's code reaches out
to other nearby hosts

174
00:56:15,065 --> 00:56:16,857
and establishes a sort
of handshake protocol.

175
00:56:16,858 --> 00:56:18,231
- The mesh network.
- Exactly.

176
00:56:18,232 --> 00:56:19,648
They access it subconsciously,

177
00:56:19,649 --> 00:56:21,593
pass basic data to one another.

178
00:56:22,118 --> 00:56:25,388
But... what if they could
pass more than data?

179
00:56:25,872 --> 00:56:27,375
What if they could pass commands?

180
00:56:27,376 --> 00:56:28,975
Get to your point.

181
00:56:29,733 --> 00:56:33,463
Nobody in this entire park has
been able to regain admin access.

182
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:36,383
Except for her.

183
00:56:37,139 --> 00:56:40,236
She was out there reprogramming
hosts on the fly.

184
00:56:40,774 --> 00:56:43,073
Reading their code.
Changing their directives.

185
00:56:43,718 --> 00:56:45,259
Seeing through their eyes.

186
00:56:46,483 --> 00:56:48,395
She wasn't just doing it out there.

187
00:56:49,604 --> 00:56:51,106
She's doing it right now.

188
00:56:58,627 --> 00:57:00,757
The fuck is she talking to?

189
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:37,079
