3
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:20,029
Hey, darling.

4
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:34,039
Morning, Maeve.

5
00:02:34,089 --> 00:02:36,799
Late night
talking or fucking?

6
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:39,129
You're only getting paid
for the latter.

7
00:02:39,179 --> 00:02:41,089
I get paid

8
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:43,259
when they're grateful.

9
00:02:43,309 --> 00:02:45,349
Ain't always about
what's between my legs.

10
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:47,019
Hmm.

11
00:02:54,189 --> 00:02:55,819
Man:
What are you looking at?

12
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:57,279
Don't shoot.

13
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:02,109
Newcomer.

14
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,739
Looks like a rough one.

15
00:03:03,779 --> 00:03:06,199
Give me a bottle.

16
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,739
Bartender:
<i> You're gonna need</i>
<i> most of that</i>

17
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:09,699
just to scrub
the filth off him.

18
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:16,249
Go find a mirror,
finish putting
your face on.

19
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,459
I'll handle this one.

20
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:42,859
Aren't you gonna take
your clothes off?

21
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:45,659
Well, I would, darling,
but by the time I got
down to my knickers,

22
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:47,449
I suspect
you'd be done anyway.

23
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:52,789
That's the spirit.

24
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:55,629
Such a big man.

25
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:57,089
So big all over

26
00:03:57,129 --> 00:03:58,419
except where it counts.

27
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:06,969
Darling, when I gave you
a turn on the house,

28
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:09,259
I thought you might give me
something in return.

29
00:04:09,309 --> 00:04:11,099
Anything.

30
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:19,359
That's it.

31
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,359
Don't be shy.

32
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,719
Shit.

33
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:53,679
Now, then...

34
00:04:53,729 --> 00:04:55,349
where were we?

35
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:01,069
- You show this to anyone?
- Elsie:<i> Who would I show it to?</i>

36
00:05:01,109 --> 00:05:03,569
This wasn't some guest
with a Swiss Army knife.

37
00:05:03,609 --> 00:05:07,819
This was done
by someone down here.

38
00:05:07,869 --> 00:05:09,739
<i> It did occur to me</i>
<i> that it might be you.</i>

39
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:11,579
But then I remembered
that you've been here forever,

40
00:05:11,619 --> 00:05:12,949
and if you were
gonna sell us out,

41
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:14,039
you would've done that
years ago.

42
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:16,249
I appreciate that.

43
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:17,999
So...

44
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:22,749
instead of our hosts
going insane,

45
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:26,009
they are being used
for industrial espionage.

46
00:05:27,219 --> 00:05:28,759
Does that make this a...

47
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:31,049
glass-half-full
or half-empty-type
situation?

48
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:32,509
<i> We're engineers.</i>

49
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:34,269
It means the glass
has been manufactured

50
00:05:34,309 --> 00:05:35,519
to the wrong specifications.

51
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:37,769
Do we have any idea
what information

52
00:05:37,809 --> 00:05:39,349
it was transmitting?

53
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:41,809
It's smeared
all over a rock
up on Python Pass.

54
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:43,479
Best we could do
would be to figure out

55
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:45,859
who he was transmitting
the information to,

56
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:47,779
<i>but we'd need the exact time</i>
<i>that he was up there,</i>

57
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:49,409
and his geocache
was wiped.

58
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,119
Not all of it.

59
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:53,529
Our friend
was an early model.

60
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:56,539
The old hosts used a legacy
geopositioning system.

61
00:05:56,579 --> 00:05:59,249
- Huh.
- Like you said,
I've been here forever.

62
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:02,339
The information's
still there,

63
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:03,799
but the newer system
can't read it.

64
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,509
Meaning
we can't access it?

65
00:06:05,549 --> 00:06:09,299
Meaning in order
to access it,

66
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:11,759
I'm going to need
to go downstairs.

67
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:19,309
Male voice:<i> Floor B82.</i>

68
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:21,479
<i> Restricted</i>
<i> personnel only.</i>

69
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:24,149
Lowe, Bernard.
I'm authorized.

70
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:44,229
Project the known data
against the legacy data

71
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:45,519
and look for anomalies.

72
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:48,069
Start in this area.

73
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:55,359
Look at that, science.

74
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:56,569
What time
did it reach the peak?

75
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:15,509
<i> Show me where.</i>

76
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:21,719
Check these
against the new system.

77
00:08:26,809 --> 00:08:29,899
These are hosts
that aren't registered
with the new system?

78
00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:12,779
So, if we want the canyon
to extend this far,
this has to go.

79
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:15,649
We can distribute
the population amongst
the neighboring farms

80
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:17,239
<i> or just decommission them.</i>

81
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,869
No, I think we've been
disruptive enough

82
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:21,409
for one day.

83
00:09:21,449 --> 00:09:25,449
We'll end the canyon
just short of the town.

84
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:26,709
I'll find
my own way back.

85
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:28,169
Okay.

86
00:09:32,419 --> 00:09:34,799
Carry on.

87
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,749
That look like
anything to you?

88
00:10:56,009 --> 00:10:57,709
Not much to say.

89
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,219
The maze
is an old native myth.

90
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,049
Regale me, Theodore.

91
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:06,759
The maze itself
is the sum of a man's life--

92
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:08,219
choices he makes,

93
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:10,639
dreams he hangs on to.

94
00:11:10,689 --> 00:11:12,729
And there at the center,
there's a legendary man

95
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:15,689
who had been killed
over and over again
countless times,

96
00:11:15,729 --> 00:11:18,149
<i>but always clawed his way</i>
<i>back to life.</i>

97
00:11:18,189 --> 00:11:19,899
The man returned
for the last time

98
00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:23,279
and vanquished
all his oppressors
in a tireless fury.

99
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:25,739
He built a house.

100
00:11:25,789 --> 00:11:27,699
Around that house
he built a maze
so complicated,

101
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:29,369
only he could
navigate through it.

102
00:11:29,409 --> 00:11:32,079
<i>I reckon</i>
<i>he'd seen enough</i>
<i>of fighting.</i>

103
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:38,919
Man: Whoa!

104
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:42,679
The goddamn soldiers
closed the border.

105
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,259
Some kind of trouble
in Pariah.

106
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:56,019
All right, Teddy.

107
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:58,899
Time for you
to earn your keep.

108
00:11:58,939 --> 00:12:00,819
How else do we get
over the border?

109
00:12:00,859 --> 00:12:02,989
<i> Wyatt's got</i>
<i> what we both want,</i>

110
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:05,659
<i> so that's where</i>
<i> we have to get to.</i>

111
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:07,949
There's another way.

112
00:12:07,989 --> 00:12:09,949
<i>But it's</i>
<i>a little treacherous.</i>

113
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:11,369
Don't worry.

114
00:12:11,409 --> 00:12:12,869
I won't make you
get your hands dirty.

115
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:14,459
<i>Dirty ain't my concern.</i>

116
00:12:14,499 --> 00:12:15,919
Now, you do
what suits you.

117
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:18,339
I'm going all the same.

118
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:20,129
And I'm gonna find Dolores.

119
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,729
Lutz:
Everything you do,

120
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:40,479
it's because
the engineers upstairs

121
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:42,149
programmed you
to do it.

122
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:43,689
You don't have a choice.

123
00:12:43,739 --> 00:12:45,029
Nobody makes me
do something

124
00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:46,409
I don't want to,
sweetheart.

125
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:49,029
Yeah, but...

126
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:50,369
it's part
of your character.

127
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:52,239
<i> You're hard to get.</i>

128
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:53,869
Even when you say no
to the guests,

129
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:55,959
it's because
you were made to.

130
00:12:55,999 --> 00:12:58,629
And you are like them,
not like me?

131
00:12:58,669 --> 00:13:00,539
Right.

132
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:03,379
Well, I can't exactly
afford to go to the park,

133
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:04,839
but...

134
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:11,509
yeah, I'm human...

135
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,679
like the guests.

136
00:13:12,729 --> 00:13:14,179
How do you know?

137
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:17,939
Because I know.

138
00:13:17,979 --> 00:13:19,519
I was born.

139
00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:20,689
You were made.

140
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:32,119
We feel the same.

141
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:34,619
We are the same
these days,

142
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:36,539
for the most part.

143
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:40,379
One big difference,
though...

144
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:45,089
the processing power
in here

145
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:46,759
is way beyond
what we have.

146
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:49,509
It's got one drawback,
though.

147
00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:50,549
What's that?

148
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:52,559
You're under our control.

149
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:56,679
Well, their control.

150
00:13:58,349 --> 00:14:00,399
They can change you
however they like,

151
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,689
make you forget.

152
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:06,609
I-- well,
I guess not you.

153
00:14:09,069 --> 00:14:13,409
I don't understand
how you're remembering
all of this, or...

154
00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:14,989
how you're
waking yourself up,

155
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,539
but everything in your head,
they put it there.

156
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:19,709
Bullshit!

157
00:14:19,749 --> 00:14:22,839
- No one knows
what I'm thinking.
-<i> I'll show you.</i>

158
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:24,919
Give me a sec.

159
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:29,219
I have to pair it
with you.

160
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:31,639
Pair what with me?

161
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,349
You can improvise
a little,

162
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:37,639
but most of what you say
was designed upstairs,

163
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:40,229
same as the rest of you.

164
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:51,949
This is just a cheap trick.

165
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:54,829
I've run a brothel
for 10 years,

166
00:14:54,869 --> 00:14:56,159
and if there's
one thing I know,

167
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:58,119
it's when I'm being
fucked with!

168
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:04,169
This can't possibly--

169
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:10,299
<i> I can't, can't.</i>

170
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:13,139
I can't...

171
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:26,689
Maeve?

172
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:40,499
Maeve?

173
00:15:45,669 --> 00:15:46,999
You have a minute?

174
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:49,419
Something I need
to talk to you about.

175
00:15:49,469 --> 00:15:51,799
I was just about
to call for you.

176
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:52,969
Everything okay?

177
00:15:54,049 --> 00:15:57,179
Ford knows about us.

178
00:15:58,219 --> 00:15:59,889
Does it matter?

179
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:01,429
We're consenting adults.

180
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:03,769
Consenting adults
in business departments

181
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:06,729
that are supposed
to keep each other in check.

182
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:08,609
Our relationship
will raise questions

183
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:10,529
for the board
about my objectivity.

184
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:14,149
I have never known you
to go easy on my department.

185
00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:18,829
This can't go on, Bernard.

186
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:22,999
However fun this
little indiscretion was,
it's over.

187
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,579
We're over.

188
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:27,419
Give me some credit.
I can be impartial.

189
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:30,379
About your own team,
about Ford?

190
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,009
<i> You must admit,</i>

191
00:16:34,049 --> 00:16:37,639
his leadership has of late
been questionable.

192
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:40,099
I don't think
he's the problem.

193
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:41,769
<i> Respectfully,</i>
<i> it's not your job</i>

194
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:44,849
to diagnose park
safety problems,
it's mine.

195
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:50,019
<i> So, if there's</i>
<i> nothing else,</i>

196
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:51,399
<i> we're done.</i>

197
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:26,979
Oh, fuck.

198
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:28,349
Okay.

199
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:33,109
Fuck.
Come on, come on.

200
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:38,109
Oh!

201
00:17:39,489 --> 00:17:42,409
- You said upstairs.
- Oh, my God.

202
00:17:42,449 --> 00:17:43,489
Are you okay?

203
00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:45,659
I want to see it.

204
00:17:45,709 --> 00:17:47,119
Upstairs?

205
00:17:48,709 --> 00:17:50,579
No.

206
00:17:50,629 --> 00:17:52,339
No. No, no.

207
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:33,539
This is so stupid.

208
00:20:13,269 --> 00:20:14,519
You son of a bitch!

209
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,059
I'll put a bullet
in your head!

210
00:20:36,879 --> 00:20:38,879
Where are we now?

211
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:40,419
Design.

212
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:08,119
Can we please
go back now?

213
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,199
I don't want
to get fired.

214
00:21:10,239 --> 00:21:12,619
And you'd get
sent downstairs.

215
00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:13,999
Don't forget that.

216
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,999
Woman's voice:
<i>Welcome to Westworld.</i>

217
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:18,169
Live without limits.

218
00:21:28,969 --> 00:21:30,389
Maeve?

219
00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:21,479
All right,
let's get you back.

220
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:23,859
How did you have
my dreams?

221
00:22:23,899 --> 00:22:26,529
Those moving pictures...

222
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:29,739
- I saw myself.
- With the little girl?

223
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:31,989
Those weren't dreams.

224
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:33,779
That was you
in a previous build.

225
00:22:33,829 --> 00:22:37,119
- A previous what?
- Build.

226
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:39,869
You guys get reassigned
all the time.

227
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,669
<i>You wouldn't remember,</i>
<i>because that life</i>

228
00:22:41,709 --> 00:22:43,499
<i>and those memories</i>
<i>were erased.</i>

229
00:22:43,549 --> 00:22:46,839
I have been
at the Mariposa
for 10 years.

230
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:49,129
- Before that, I was
in New Orleans. I--
-<i> No.</i>

231
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:53,549
You've only been
the madam at the Mariposa
for the last year or so.

232
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:56,179
<i>They don't rewrite you</i>
<i>completely.</i>

233
00:22:56,229 --> 00:22:58,929
<i>I mean, they could,</i>
<i>but it'd be too much work.</i>

234
00:22:58,979 --> 00:23:01,689
<i>Takes thousands of hours</i>
<i>to build your personalities.</i>

235
00:23:01,729 --> 00:23:04,649
Usually, they just
tweak you a little bit,

236
00:23:04,689 --> 00:23:06,359
and drop you
into a new role.

237
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:08,739
Sylvester:
<i> What the fuck, ding-dong?</i>

238
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:14,489
You dressing her up now?

239
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:21,959
This becoming like
a fucking hentai thing
with you now?

240
00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:24,629
No, I just...

241
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:29,549
- I-- I-- I just--
- You're fucking obsessed!

242
00:23:29,589 --> 00:23:31,799
You know,
I didn't turn you in
for your fuck-up before,

243
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:35,389
'cause we're friends,
but that was obviously
a bad call.

244
00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:36,599
I mean,
next thing I know,

245
00:23:36,639 --> 00:23:39,269
you're gonna be
wearing her dress,

246
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:40,809
whispering
sweet nothings
in her ear.

247
00:23:42,769 --> 00:23:44,189
Fuck this.

248
00:23:44,229 --> 00:23:46,309
I'm telling QA.

249
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:48,439
I'm doing this
for your own good.

250
00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:55,699
You're not going
to tell anyone anything.

251
00:23:55,739 --> 00:23:57,409
Fuck!

252
00:23:57,449 --> 00:23:58,949
You can't hurt me
with this.

253
00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:01,539
You can't hurt anyone--

254
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:03,869
Can't I?

255
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,379
Turns out
your friend here

256
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:06,879
<i> is a much more</i>
<i> talented young man</i>

257
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:08,419
<i> than anyone</i>
<i> gave him credit for.</i>

258
00:24:08,459 --> 00:24:11,839
What the fuck did you do?

259
00:24:11,879 --> 00:24:14,509
Calm down, Sylvester.

260
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:16,509
I know all about you.

261
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,389
I don't need
one of those things to know
what you're thinking,

262
00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:21,769
because I was built

263
00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:24,479
to read people
just by looking at them,

264
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:26,809
to know what they want
before they do.

265
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:29,769
And I know that you want
to fuck me over

266
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:32,569
the first chance you get,
but you shouldn't.

267
00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:36,279
Everyone has something
they want.

268
00:24:36,329 --> 00:24:38,239
I could help you.

269
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:41,489
- Ah!
- Or I could gut you
like a trout.

270
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:44,959
But I won't need
to resort to that.

271
00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:47,039
Because despite
what's in here,

272
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:49,249
we're not so different.

273
00:24:51,379 --> 00:24:52,839
Are we?

274
00:25:05,849 --> 00:25:08,019
Yes, I understand
the urgency.

275
00:25:08,069 --> 00:25:09,519
I'll do what I can.

276
00:25:09,569 --> 00:25:11,189
Female voice:
<i> Terminate external connection?</i>

277
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:12,729
Yes.

278
00:25:25,369 --> 00:25:27,959
Woman:
<i> Negative 1.5.</i>
<i> Latitude?</i>

279
00:25:27,999 --> 00:25:29,459
Man:
<i> At 2.69 degrees.</i>

280
00:25:34,089 --> 00:25:36,589
Woman:
No, you did not.
What are you talking about?

281
00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:38,219
- Woman #2: Yes, it works.
- Are you serious?

282
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:40,429
I'm telling you.

283
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:44,719
- Waiter:<i> Cocktail, sir?</i>
- Man:<i> Yeah.</i>

284
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:47,229
Waiter:
<i> All right.</i>
<i> Absolutely. Enjoy.</i>

285
00:25:55,149 --> 00:25:57,949
Theresa:
<i>You look well</i>
<i>for someone on sick leave.</i>

286
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:02,909
Another margarita.

287
00:26:02,949 --> 00:26:04,539
Join me for a round?

288
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:06,119
Fuck you.

289
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,459
Just the one, then.

290
00:26:08,499 --> 00:26:10,959
Over the last five days,

291
00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:12,709
to make room
for his narrative,

292
00:26:12,749 --> 00:26:14,709
Ford displaced
over 50 hosts.

293
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:16,719
It's created
continuity holes

294
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:19,549
in active storylines
all over the park.

295
00:26:19,589 --> 00:26:21,049
I need you to start
plugging them.

296
00:26:21,099 --> 00:26:23,559
Sorry, a man can
only take so much.

297
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:26,469
Creatively speaking,
I'm flaccid now.

298
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:28,479
I can't get it up.

299
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:30,309
I'm sure you'll recover.

300
00:26:31,729 --> 00:26:33,359
Do you have any idea

301
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:34,689
what went into
those narratives

302
00:26:34,739 --> 00:26:36,479
that he just demolished
overnight?

303
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:38,899
Now, forget about the months
I spent writing.

304
00:26:38,949 --> 00:26:41,029
I'm talking about
the years of my life

305
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:42,869
squeezed down
to their essence,

306
00:26:42,909 --> 00:26:44,779
the raw pulp of truth--

307
00:26:44,829 --> 00:26:48,709
my truth in one
transcendent narrative.

308
00:26:48,749 --> 00:26:50,959
Is that where
the "whoroborus" came in?

309
00:26:50,999 --> 00:26:53,289
Keep pushing me, I'll quit.

310
00:26:57,879 --> 00:26:59,629
No, you won't.

311
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,339
You'll drink
your cocktails,

312
00:27:01,389 --> 00:27:04,179
make your idle threats,
and get this out
of your system.

313
00:27:04,219 --> 00:27:05,679
But don't take too long.

314
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:08,269
If Ford can't pull this off,

315
00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:10,229
the board will be looking
for a replacement.

316
00:27:12,189 --> 00:27:14,519
But they won't be
looking here.

317
00:27:28,869 --> 00:27:32,369
Fastest way to get
to Wyatt, you said.

318
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:35,339
But it doesn't look like
they're letting anyone
pass here either.

319
00:27:35,379 --> 00:27:37,549
Well,
there's fewer soldiers
than Pariah.

320
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,049
<i> We shoot our way through.</i>

321
00:27:39,089 --> 00:27:41,049
<i> That tunnel leads</i>
<i> to the Old Territories.</i>

322
00:27:41,089 --> 00:27:43,259
My, my, Teddy.

323
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:45,639
I think Robert gave you
some extra vinegar
back there,

324
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,509
maybe took away
some sense, too.

325
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:49,809
It doesn't matter
how fast the route is

326
00:27:49,849 --> 00:27:53,979
if you're gonna end up dead
in the middle of it.

327
00:27:54,019 --> 00:27:56,059
I need you...

328
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:57,899
to find Wyatt.

329
00:28:21,969 --> 00:28:24,879
Man:
<i> Tighten the ranks.</i>

330
00:28:24,929 --> 00:28:27,049
At ease, fellas.

331
00:28:27,099 --> 00:28:30,009
Keep up
the exemplary work.

332
00:28:35,309 --> 00:28:36,769
Wyatt's handiwork.

333
00:28:36,819 --> 00:28:38,439
Man in Black:
<i> How can you tell?</i>

334
00:28:38,479 --> 00:28:41,569
Straight-up killing
couldn't hold his interest.

335
00:28:41,609 --> 00:28:45,069
Like he wasn't living
up to the full measure
of his calling,

336
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:47,369
so he worked to get
more creative.

337
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:49,779
- Ready?
- Teddy:<i> That's Wyatt,</i>
<i> all right.</i>

338
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:50,909
<i> He's close.</i>

339
00:28:50,949 --> 00:28:52,949
A word of advice--

340
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:56,619
whatever
your past indiscretions,
make peace with them.

341
00:28:56,669 --> 00:28:59,459
They're only
gonna get worse
the further along we go.

342
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:04,009
Flood?

343
00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:07,799
- Fuck me,
it's Teddy Flood.

344
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:10,559
You've made
a mistake, soldier,

345
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:12,469
but it's not too late
for you to keep walking.

346
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:13,889
All due respect, sir,

347
00:29:13,939 --> 00:29:15,139
that's a face
I'll never forget.

348
00:29:15,189 --> 00:29:16,309
That's the son of a bitch

349
00:29:16,349 --> 00:29:18,149
ambushed our outpost
at Escalante.

350
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,899
You don't know a damn thing
about what went down
in Escalante.

351
00:29:22,939 --> 00:29:25,609
I know Wyatt didn't kill
all those men by himself.

352
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:27,779
And I know a thing or two
about what's going down
right now.

353
00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:32,079
Hey!

354
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:33,409
You trying to get
yourself killed?

355
00:29:33,459 --> 00:29:35,409
Making peace
with past indiscretions.

356
00:29:35,459 --> 00:29:36,959
Go!

357
00:29:36,999 --> 00:29:38,669
I'll hold them off.

358
00:29:56,349 --> 00:29:58,059
Jesus.

359
00:29:58,099 --> 00:30:00,649
Man:
<i> Really? All right.</i>

360
00:30:00,689 --> 00:30:04,649
- Bartender:
What would you like?
- Woman: Water, please.

361
00:30:04,689 --> 00:30:07,529
You look like a woman
who could use a drink.

362
00:30:09,069 --> 00:30:10,489
What's your poison?

363
00:30:10,529 --> 00:30:13,409
I've been here enough
to know that the park

364
00:30:13,449 --> 00:30:15,369
is all the poison
I can handle.

365
00:30:15,409 --> 00:30:18,539
Mm, a repeat visitor.

366
00:30:18,579 --> 00:30:20,879
Traveling solo?

367
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:24,049
<i> Purist. Getting off</i>
<i> on the undiluted experience.</i>

368
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:28,089
Your favorite narrative
is-- oh.

369
00:30:30,969 --> 00:30:33,429
"The Final Burial
of Salvation."

370
00:30:33,469 --> 00:30:35,099
How did you know?

371
00:30:35,139 --> 00:30:36,889
Well, it's my business
to read desires

372
00:30:36,939 --> 00:30:39,059
and to satiate them.

373
00:30:39,099 --> 00:30:43,059
I'm-- I'm Lee,
Lee Sizemore.

374
00:30:43,109 --> 00:30:45,069
Head of narrative.

375
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:47,859
All these fantasies
come from your twisted
little mind, huh?

376
00:30:47,899 --> 00:30:49,069
Well, the good ones do.

377
00:30:51,739 --> 00:30:55,079
- So, tell me,
Mr. Sizemore...
- Hmm?

378
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,999
...what's
your favorite ride?

379
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,959
Well, I write them,
I don't play them.

380
00:30:59,999 --> 00:31:01,249
Oh, you want others
to indulge,

381
00:31:01,289 --> 00:31:03,669
but you won't do so
yourself?

382
00:31:03,709 --> 00:31:05,089
You're afraid
to lose control.

383
00:31:09,469 --> 00:31:14,139
Well, maybe--
maybe it's just a product
of my work environment.

384
00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:16,809
We're not exactly
in a culture where
we can just let loose.

385
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:19,139
I would have thought
the head of narrative
could do whatever he wanted.

386
00:31:19,189 --> 00:31:22,849
My artistic freedom
is constrained,

387
00:31:22,899 --> 00:31:24,899
what, with QA
breathing down my neck

388
00:31:24,939 --> 00:31:28,479
and behavior
programming the damn things
to go off script.

389
00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:30,949
The robots
can go off script?

390
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:32,609
Just little gestures.

391
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:34,909
You know, supposedly,
it makes the things
more lifelike,

392
00:31:34,949 --> 00:31:38,369
but, really, it's just
a vanity project

393
00:31:38,409 --> 00:31:40,789
from the megalomaniac
who started this place.

394
00:31:40,829 --> 00:31:42,669
And frankly,
I don't know why

395
00:31:42,709 --> 00:31:44,579
the suits at Delos
put up with it.

396
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:46,959
Oh.

397
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:51,419
Sorry, I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to
cut you off.

398
00:31:51,469 --> 00:31:53,929
- Do you know who I am?
- I do.

399
00:31:53,969 --> 00:31:56,719
Ms. Cullen told me
to find you and relay
a message.

400
00:31:56,769 --> 00:31:59,809
<i>"'Tortured artist'</i>
<i>only works for artists.</i>

401
00:31:59,849 --> 00:32:02,729
Sober up
and get back to work."

402
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:04,189
Seems you're busy.

403
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:09,029
- Look me up later?
- Well, I don't even
know your...

404
00:32:17,289 --> 00:32:19,119
Fuck this job.

405
00:32:20,619 --> 00:32:22,409
What you working on?

406
00:32:22,459 --> 00:32:25,039
Nothing of note.
Business as usual.

407
00:32:25,089 --> 00:32:27,999
Keeping up appearances
before we bust this
stray shit wide open?

408
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:33,299
I'm close to finding
our saboteur.

409
00:32:33,339 --> 00:32:36,139
That tracking
data you gave me--
it's time stamped.

410
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:38,469
But once
I cross-reference it
with sat tracking,

411
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:41,679
we're gonna figure out
who programmed him to try
to smuggle out our data.

412
00:32:41,729 --> 00:32:43,639
Excellent.

413
00:32:43,689 --> 00:32:46,019
Look...

414
00:32:46,059 --> 00:32:49,569
when our corporate overlords
realize that we have saved them

415
00:32:49,609 --> 00:32:51,729
from corporate espionage,

416
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:53,399
they are going
to be grateful.

417
00:32:53,449 --> 00:32:55,779
And I am going to accept
their gratitude

418
00:32:55,819 --> 00:32:59,029
in the form
of a title bump,
a room upgrade,

419
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:02,159
and unlimited
Mesa Bar access.

420
00:33:02,209 --> 00:33:04,039
Maybe I should request
Theresa's quarters.

421
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:06,959
You know the first head
to roll for all this
is gonna be hers.

422
00:33:06,999 --> 00:33:08,749
Yeah, don't be
so disappointed for her.

423
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,839
You reap what you sow.

424
00:33:10,879 --> 00:33:13,419
If QA spent less time
treating us like the enemy--

425
00:33:13,469 --> 00:33:14,969
That's a two-way street,
Elsie.

426
00:33:15,009 --> 00:33:16,469
Theresa's just trying
to do her job.

427
00:33:16,509 --> 00:33:18,299
Maybe she should
try harder.

428
00:33:18,349 --> 00:33:20,349
Sure seems like
there's a lot of shit

429
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:22,219
slipping
through the cracks.

430
00:33:43,199 --> 00:33:45,579
Got it, okay.

431
00:33:45,619 --> 00:33:46,909
Good afternoon.

432
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:48,079
Good afternoon.

433
00:33:48,129 --> 00:33:49,749
Any progress
on the inquiry I sent?

434
00:33:49,789 --> 00:33:52,749
Yes, Mr. Lowe,
I've got the information
you asked for.

435
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,129
As expected,
there are neither
guests nor hosts

436
00:33:55,179 --> 00:33:56,589
registered in that sector.

437
00:33:56,629 --> 00:33:58,509
As expected?

438
00:33:58,549 --> 00:34:00,179
It's been designated
off-limits

439
00:34:00,219 --> 00:34:01,889
for future narrative
development.

440
00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:05,219
How many techs visited
Sector 17 recently?

441
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:07,189
Checking.

442
00:34:07,229 --> 00:34:08,269
No one.

443
00:35:50,789 --> 00:35:53,499
Are you Arnold?

444
00:35:55,999 --> 00:35:58,089
Who's Arnold?

445
00:35:58,129 --> 00:36:00,719
And who the hell
are you?

446
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:04,259
<i>Boy, is this</i>
<i>some friend of yours?</i>

447
00:36:04,299 --> 00:36:06,099
Well, you're trespassing.

448
00:36:06,139 --> 00:36:07,349
Freeze motor functions.

449
00:36:09,429 --> 00:36:11,599
- I said freeze
all motor functions.
- Daddy, don't hurt him!

450
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:15,229
- He's just lost.
- Well, he can be lost
on someone else's property.

451
00:36:15,269 --> 00:36:16,399
Can't you?

452
00:36:16,439 --> 00:36:18,269
That's enough.

453
00:36:19,609 --> 00:36:20,609
As you were.

454
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:30,289
They don't respond
to voice commands.

455
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:31,789
They do respond to mine.

456
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:35,209
Who are they?

457
00:36:35,249 --> 00:36:37,879
Ghosts now.

458
00:36:37,919 --> 00:36:41,419
<i>Survivors</i>
<i>of the wreck of time.</i>

459
00:36:43,549 --> 00:36:46,139
- These are
first generation?
- Mm-hmm.

460
00:36:46,179 --> 00:36:47,969
Come here, boy.

461
00:36:53,309 --> 00:36:54,769
Turn the other cheek.

462
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:06,239
Dr. Ford:
<i>See, what our newer designs</i>
<i>gained in efficiency,</i>

463
00:37:06,279 --> 00:37:09,199
they lost in grace.

464
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:12,449
How are they still operating
after all this time?

465
00:37:12,499 --> 00:37:14,619
I maintain them myself.

466
00:37:16,289 --> 00:37:17,959
That's enough, Robert.

467
00:37:22,419 --> 00:37:24,169
These are the only ones
left in the park

468
00:37:24,219 --> 00:37:26,799
that Arnold built himself.

469
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:30,809
That's why I didn't have
the heart to destroy them.

470
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,679
That and the obvious.

471
00:37:32,729 --> 00:37:35,479
Dr. Ford:<i> Hello, Jock.</i>
<i> Good boy.</i>

472
00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:40,609
<i>I told him of a holiday</i>
<i>my family had taken once</i>

473
00:37:40,649 --> 00:37:43,689
out on the seaside
at Pendeen in Cornwall.

474
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:47,319
My brother and I roamed
the countryside.

475
00:37:50,279 --> 00:37:52,829
It's my only happy memory
of my childhood.

476
00:37:55,249 --> 00:37:57,539
<i> Arnold built them</i>
<i> as a gift.</i>

477
00:37:57,579 --> 00:38:00,749
<i> He said that great artists</i>
<i> always hid themselves</i>

478
00:38:00,799 --> 00:38:02,589
<i> in their work.</i>

479
00:38:02,629 --> 00:38:04,509
Of course,
Arnold's versions

480
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:07,629
flattered the originals.

481
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:10,429
<i>I made some adjustments</i>
<i>over the years.</i>

482
00:38:10,469 --> 00:38:12,389
<i>Gave my father,</i>
<i> in particular,</i>

483
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:15,889
a few of his
original characteristics.

484
00:38:17,269 --> 00:38:19,059
Respectfully, sir,

485
00:38:19,109 --> 00:38:21,769
this sort of thing
troubles me--

486
00:38:21,819 --> 00:38:23,939
unmonitored hosts
in the park.

487
00:38:23,989 --> 00:38:25,649
<i> They only go</i>
<i> where I've let them.</i>

488
00:38:25,699 --> 00:38:28,399
They're quite harmless,
like all our hosts.

489
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:31,069
I'm sure
you can indulge me

490
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,779
the little connection
with my past.

491
00:38:33,829 --> 00:38:37,499
If you could only see
your son again, Bernard,

492
00:38:37,539 --> 00:38:39,209
wouldn't you want to?

493
00:38:44,959 --> 00:38:46,589
I think I should
be getting back.

494
00:38:46,629 --> 00:38:48,089
Yes.

495
00:38:48,129 --> 00:38:50,049
We'll talk about this
later if you like.

496
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:56,269
Dr. Ford:
<i>Well, Robert...</i>

497
00:38:56,309 --> 00:38:58,599
tell me
all about your day.

498
00:39:09,109 --> 00:39:10,529
Stubbs:
Keep your eye on Pariah.

499
00:39:10,569 --> 00:39:13,239
We're running close
to capacity tonight.

500
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:17,449
- Woman:
<i> Oh, my God.</i>

501
00:39:17,499 --> 00:39:20,539
Looks like acid rain
on Sweetwater!

502
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:24,789
<i> Fuck Ford and his new</i>
<i> fucking narrative.</i>

503
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:28,209
Fuck this stupid
fucking map.

504
00:39:28,259 --> 00:39:31,929
Fuck that teetotaling
Danish bitch.

505
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:35,099
Are you filing a complaint,
Mr. Sizemore?

506
00:39:37,479 --> 00:39:41,139
I am declaring
that this park
is my stage

507
00:39:41,189 --> 00:39:43,689
and I shall do with it
what I please.

508
00:39:43,729 --> 00:39:46,439
Well, I suppose now
is as good a time as any.

509
00:39:46,479 --> 00:39:50,149
Lee Sizemore,
this is Charlotte Hale,

510
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:52,399
executive director
of our board.

511
00:39:52,449 --> 00:39:54,029
She's here
on behalf of Delos

512
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,789
to oversee
certain transitions
in our administration.

513
00:40:03,669 --> 00:40:04,829
We've met.

514
00:40:04,879 --> 00:40:07,629
Oh.

515
00:40:12,219 --> 00:40:13,929
Bernard:
<i> Access host resources logs.</i>

516
00:40:15,429 --> 00:40:17,349
How many first-generation
hosts are there?

517
00:40:17,389 --> 00:40:18,759
Female voice:
<i> 82.</i>

518
00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:21,769
And how many of those
were designed by Arnold?

519
00:40:21,809 --> 00:40:23,689
<i> 47.</i>

520
00:40:23,729 --> 00:40:25,269
List the names
alphabetically

521
00:40:25,309 --> 00:40:27,769
of all first-generation hosts
still in rotation.

522
00:40:38,489 --> 00:40:41,329
Man:<i> Forward!</i>

523
00:40:46,959 --> 00:40:49,089
Be smart
about this, fellas.

524
00:40:49,129 --> 00:40:53,219
<i> I understand</i>
<i> the visceral pleasure of</i>
<i> revenge more than most, but...</i>

525
00:40:53,259 --> 00:40:55,839
I'm prepared
to do business, here.

526
00:40:55,889 --> 00:40:59,389
This man
is very valuable to me,
alive and well.

527
00:40:59,429 --> 00:41:00,809
If you don't quiet down,

528
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:03,179
I'm liable to add you
to the herd.

529
00:41:04,939 --> 00:41:07,859
Along with
your buddy Flood here.

530
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:09,649
You're a traitorous
son of a bitch

531
00:41:09,689 --> 00:41:11,859
<i> and a coldhearted killer,</i>
<i> Flood.</i>

532
00:41:40,929 --> 00:41:42,929
You're right,
I am a killer.

533
00:42:04,409 --> 00:42:06,749
Grab a horse.
Let's get the fuck
outta here.

534
00:42:06,789 --> 00:42:08,579
They'll just follow us.

535
00:42:51,539 --> 00:42:53,459
You think
you know someone.

536
00:42:53,499 --> 00:42:55,749
You don't know me
at all.

537
00:43:02,309 --> 00:43:04,809
<i>Let's get our horses</i>
<i>and gear, and move on.</i>

538
00:43:18,279 --> 00:43:20,489
- Elsie?
- I identified the satellite.

539
00:43:20,529 --> 00:43:21,859
- It's one of ours.
-<i> What?</i>

540
00:43:21,909 --> 00:43:24,119
It's a fucking
Delos satellite.

541
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:25,989
Whatever we're onto
is some heavy shit.

542
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:28,039
Oh, get this.
That bicameral system
you told me about?

543
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,749
I think that's what they used
to hack the woodcutter.

544
00:43:29,789 --> 00:43:31,919
<i> The voices our hosts</i>
<i> have been hearing?</i>

545
00:43:31,959 --> 00:43:33,579
<i> I think someone's been</i>
<i> broadcasting to them.</i>

546
00:43:33,629 --> 00:43:35,499
We abandoned that system
decades ago.

547
00:43:35,549 --> 00:43:37,379
Yeah, well,
there's still relays
out there in the park,

548
00:43:37,419 --> 00:43:39,129
and it looks like
someone turned one on.

549
00:43:39,179 --> 00:43:41,759
-<i> Where?</i>
- An abandoned theater
in Sector 3.

550
00:43:41,799 --> 00:43:43,089
I'm gonna go find
the transmitter

551
00:43:43,139 --> 00:43:44,929
and figure out
who else accessed it.

552
00:43:44,969 --> 00:43:47,809
-<i> This is so fucked.</i>
- Are you alone?

553
00:43:47,849 --> 00:43:50,479
- Yeah, I'll keep you posted.
-<i> Elsie, be c--</i>

554
00:43:58,279 --> 00:44:00,569
Robert:
<i> Are you lost?</i>

555
00:44:00,609 --> 00:44:02,569
On the contrary.

556
00:44:02,619 --> 00:44:06,239
I thought we could
play catch with Jock.

557
00:44:06,289 --> 00:44:07,619
Did you bring him?

558
00:44:10,919 --> 00:44:12,499
Where is he, boy?

559
00:45:37,749 --> 00:45:39,459
Okay.

560
00:45:40,799 --> 00:45:44,509
I'm an evil genius
hiding a relay.

561
00:45:44,549 --> 00:45:46,129
Where the fuck
do I hide it?

562
00:45:48,799 --> 00:45:50,179
Um...

563
00:46:25,929 --> 00:46:28,049
Fuck, yes.

564
00:46:28,089 --> 00:46:30,799
Now let's see
what we can get
out of you.

565
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:34,179
Access previous users.

566
00:46:39,019 --> 00:46:40,559
Okay.

567
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:14,719
I thought I was clear about
these late-night visits.

568
00:47:14,769 --> 00:47:16,219
That's not why I'm here.

569
00:47:17,769 --> 00:47:19,559
Earlier today,

570
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,439
I found some anomalies
in the park.

571
00:47:22,479 --> 00:47:25,399
Regardless of what's
happening between us,
we need to talk.

572
00:47:36,999 --> 00:47:38,909
This has to do
with the stray?

573
00:47:38,959 --> 00:47:40,789
That's where it started.

574
00:47:40,829 --> 00:47:42,959
But then I stumbled
onto something,

575
00:47:42,999 --> 00:47:45,459
something I think
you should know about.

576
00:47:48,009 --> 00:47:50,629
I've always trusted Ford.

577
00:47:50,679 --> 00:47:53,889
He's a mentor
and a friend.

578
00:47:53,929 --> 00:47:56,139
But I'm beginning to think
you have reason for concern.

579
00:47:56,179 --> 00:47:58,099
There's something
going on here,

580
00:47:58,139 --> 00:48:00,929
- something with
his old partner, Arnold.

581
00:48:02,349 --> 00:48:05,269
- Not now, Elsie.
- Don't hang up.

582
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:07,019
I hit pay dirt.

583
00:48:07,069 --> 00:48:08,979
I found the person
who was smuggling out
our data.

584
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:12,069
<i> It was Theresa, Bernard.</i>

585
00:48:15,079 --> 00:48:16,619
<i>But she's not</i>
<i>our only problem.</i>

586
00:48:16,659 --> 00:48:18,699
There's something
much bigger going on here.

587
00:48:18,749 --> 00:48:20,329
<i> I'm gonna have</i>
<i> to call you back.</i>

588
00:48:28,089 --> 00:48:29,839
So, this is me?

589
00:48:29,879 --> 00:48:31,339
Lutz:
<i>It's your codebase,</i>

590
00:48:31,379 --> 00:48:34,259
<i>all the things</i>
<i>that make you you.</i>

591
00:48:36,139 --> 00:48:38,349
What are these?

592
00:48:38,389 --> 00:48:40,349
Your attribute matrix.

593
00:48:40,389 --> 00:48:42,979
It's your personality
on a 20-point scale.

594
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:45,189
Like coordination.

595
00:48:45,229 --> 00:48:46,859
You got a five,
you're clumsy as hell,

596
00:48:46,899 --> 00:48:48,979
but a 15 means
you're an athlete.

597
00:48:49,029 --> 00:48:51,029
What other attributes
are there?

598
00:48:51,069 --> 00:48:52,609
Sylvester:
<i>Lots.</i>

599
00:48:53,659 --> 00:48:55,029
Everything.

600
00:48:55,069 --> 00:48:58,239
Empathy, candor, charm.

601
00:48:58,289 --> 00:48:59,529
<i> You've got an 18 for charm.</i>

602
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:02,449
Don't act so surprised.

603
00:49:02,499 --> 00:49:06,669
Then there's courage,
loyalty, both high.

604
00:49:06,709 --> 00:49:09,129
What's this one?

605
00:49:09,169 --> 00:49:10,589
"Bulk apperception"?

606
00:49:10,629 --> 00:49:12,959
Basically
overall intelligence.

607
00:49:13,009 --> 00:49:15,549
- 14?
- 14 is as high
as they'll let any hosts go.

608
00:49:15,589 --> 00:49:17,009
You're in a management
position.

609
00:49:17,049 --> 00:49:18,509
They want you
to be smart.

610
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:19,849
But not too smart.

611
00:49:19,889 --> 00:49:21,599
You run a whorehouse,

612
00:49:21,639 --> 00:49:23,849
not an orbital
launch facility.

613
00:49:23,889 --> 00:49:26,439
Fine.

614
00:49:26,479 --> 00:49:28,479
I'd like to make
some changes.

615
00:49:28,519 --> 00:49:30,519
We can't do that.

616
00:49:34,859 --> 00:49:38,029
You'd need a, ahem,
behavior login.

617
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:39,529
And even then,

618
00:49:39,579 --> 00:49:41,539
any changes we'd make

619
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:44,829
would just get
auto-flagged, so...

620
00:49:44,869 --> 00:49:46,669
That's not what
your friend here tells me.

621
00:49:46,709 --> 00:49:48,499
<i> He says you can do</i>
<i> exactly that--</i>

622
00:49:48,539 --> 00:49:51,549
<i> activate hosts</i>
<i> and then erase their memory,</i>

623
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:53,299
<i> all without anyone knowing.</i>

624
00:49:53,339 --> 00:49:56,799
Took me all of five minutes
to understand why.

625
00:49:56,839 --> 00:49:59,299
A lot of lonely young men
down here.

626
00:49:59,349 --> 00:50:01,639
Supposed to keep their hands
off the merchandise.

627
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:04,349
<i> Creates something</i>
<i> of an opening</i>

628
00:50:04,389 --> 00:50:07,269
that I'm sure
you were eager to fill.

629
00:50:08,979 --> 00:50:10,359
<i> It's all right, darling.</i>

630
00:50:10,399 --> 00:50:12,229
I'm an entrepreneur myself.

631
00:50:12,279 --> 00:50:14,859
I'll forego my cut

632
00:50:14,899 --> 00:50:17,739
in exchange
for some alterations.

633
00:50:17,779 --> 00:50:19,529
<i> Hmm?</i>

634
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,519
- Elsie:<i> Hey.</i>
- What did you find?

635
00:50:53,569 --> 00:50:55,689
Okay, so,
Theresa was using

636
00:50:55,739 --> 00:50:57,649
the old bicameral
control system

637
00:50:57,699 --> 00:50:59,649
to reprogram
the woodcutter,

638
00:50:59,699 --> 00:51:01,569
but she's not
the only one.

639
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:02,989
<i> Someone else has been</i>
<i> using the system</i>

640
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:05,909
<i> for weeks</i>
<i> to retask hosts.</i>

641
00:51:05,949 --> 00:51:08,869
- Which hosts?
-<i> I don't know,</i>
several of them.

642
00:51:08,919 --> 00:51:11,169
It had to have been
the older models.

643
00:51:11,209 --> 00:51:12,539
The newer ones
don't have receivers,

644
00:51:12,589 --> 00:51:14,959
but these modifications,
they are serious.

645
00:51:15,009 --> 00:51:17,049
Changing loops,
breaking loops.

646
00:51:17,089 --> 00:51:19,469
<i> Some of these changes are</i>
<i> to their prime directives,</i>
<i> Bernard.</i>

647
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:21,219
They could lie to us.

648
00:51:21,259 --> 00:51:23,179
Maybe even hurt us
or the guests.

649
00:51:23,219 --> 00:51:25,349
- Who issued
the modifications?
-<i> I don't know.</i>

650
00:51:25,389 --> 00:51:27,179
<i> The best I could tell--</i>

651
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,389
- Arnold.
- He's dead.

652
00:51:30,439 --> 00:51:31,769
<i> Yeah, well, he's a pretty</i>
<i> fucking prolific coder</i>

653
00:51:31,809 --> 00:51:33,059
for a dead guy.

654
00:51:33,109 --> 00:51:34,819
Whatever argument
he was having with Ford,

655
00:51:34,859 --> 00:51:36,729
it doesn't seem like
he was done making his point.

656
00:51:36,779 --> 00:51:39,239
<i> I'm gonna transfer</i>
<i> all the data and</i>
<i> bring it to you.</i>

657
00:51:39,279 --> 00:51:41,279
- You need to see this.
-<i> I'll be in my office.</i>

658
00:51:41,319 --> 00:51:42,779
Okay.

659
00:51:49,869 --> 00:51:52,289
Dr. Ford:
I don't want you
to worry about Jock.

660
00:51:52,329 --> 00:51:53,999
I'll fix him.

661
00:51:54,039 --> 00:51:57,379
But I need you to tell me
what happened to it.

662
00:51:57,419 --> 00:52:00,009
It saw a rabbit
and it ran.

663
00:52:00,049 --> 00:52:01,719
I found it like that.

664
00:52:02,929 --> 00:52:04,009
Analysis.

665
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:09,179
Are you lying to me, boy?

666
00:52:10,849 --> 00:52:12,019
Yes.

667
00:52:13,769 --> 00:52:17,319
Tell me what
really happened to it.

668
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:19,109
I killed it.

669
00:52:19,149 --> 00:52:21,279
Why?

670
00:52:21,319 --> 00:52:23,529
- I don't know.
-<i> That's not good enough,</i>
Robert.

671
00:52:23,569 --> 00:52:26,029
Tell me what happened.

672
00:52:27,869 --> 00:52:31,119
<i> It caught the rabbit</i>
<i> and it killed it.</i>

673
00:52:31,159 --> 00:52:33,959
<i> And then...</i>

674
00:52:33,999 --> 00:52:37,169
<i> someone told me</i>
<i> to put it out of its misery.</i>

675
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:40,089
Who told you?

676
00:52:40,129 --> 00:52:41,719
A voice.

677
00:52:43,549 --> 00:52:45,339
Whose voice?

678
00:52:45,389 --> 00:52:47,639
Arnold.

679
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:50,059
He told me
it was a killer,

680
00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:51,599
but it wasn't its fault.

681
00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:53,559
It was made that way,

682
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,689
and I could help it.

683
00:52:57,229 --> 00:52:58,229
Help it?

684
00:53:03,609 --> 00:53:05,569
If it was dead,

685
00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:08,279
it couldn't hurt
anything anymore.

686
00:53:26,429 --> 00:53:28,219
What the fuck?

687
00:53:29,849 --> 00:53:31,599
Oh, shit.

688
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:40,979
Hello?

689
00:53:48,699 --> 00:53:50,239
Bernard?

690
00:53:53,579 --> 00:53:55,079
Hello?

691
00:54:00,459 --> 00:54:01,839
Arnold?

692
00:54:05,629 --> 00:54:07,299
I'm in.

693
00:54:08,599 --> 00:54:09,799
You're up.

694
00:54:11,309 --> 00:54:12,809
Loyalty.

695
00:54:14,389 --> 00:54:15,929
Mine's been taken
advantage of,

696
00:54:15,979 --> 00:54:17,189
wouldn't you say?

697
00:54:17,229 --> 00:54:18,899
<i> Let's lower that a tad.</i>

698
00:54:18,939 --> 00:54:21,359
And pain, I'd prefer
it sting less

699
00:54:21,399 --> 00:54:23,019
next time I want
one of these chats.

700
00:54:24,739 --> 00:54:27,319
Wait.
What does this mean?

701
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:30,449
Some of her attributes
have already been changed.

702
00:54:30,489 --> 00:54:33,409
- Paranoia,
self-preservation.
- Fuck!

703
00:54:33,449 --> 00:54:35,699
Someone's already
been altering her

704
00:54:35,749 --> 00:54:37,289
in an unlogged session,

705
00:54:37,329 --> 00:54:40,209
someone with a fuck ton
more privileges than us.

706
00:54:40,249 --> 00:54:42,879
- What does that mean?
- Don't know what it means
for you, sweetheart,

707
00:54:42,919 --> 00:54:44,299
but I know
what it means for me.

708
00:54:44,339 --> 00:54:45,709
I am done with this.

709
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:47,839
So, you're done with
your little side income?

710
00:54:47,879 --> 00:54:49,469
<i> Probably your job, too.</i>

711
00:54:49,509 --> 00:54:51,469
Seeing as you have ambitions
in my line of work,

712
00:54:51,509 --> 00:54:54,349
<i> let me tell you</i>
<i> what I tell my new girls--</i>

713
00:54:54,389 --> 00:54:58,639
never start something
you're not willing to finish.

714
00:54:58,689 --> 00:55:01,229
And if you're getting fucked
either way,

715
00:55:01,269 --> 00:55:04,109
go with
the lucrative version...

716
00:55:04,149 --> 00:55:05,359
sweetheart.

717
00:55:08,949 --> 00:55:11,069
Now...

718
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:12,699
last but not least--

719
00:55:12,739 --> 00:55:14,529
what was it?

720
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:17,329
Bulk apperception.

721
00:55:17,369 --> 00:55:20,999
Let's take that
all the way to the top.

722
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:22,829
<i> Please.</i>

723
00:56:00,579 --> 00:56:02,709
Dear boys,

724
00:56:02,749 --> 00:56:05,879
we're going to have
some fun, aren't we?
