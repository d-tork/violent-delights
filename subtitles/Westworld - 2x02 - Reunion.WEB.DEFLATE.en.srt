2
00:00:02,789 --> 00:00:05,400
Hello, Dolores. Welcome to the world.

3
00:00:05,401 --> 00:00:07,562
There's something different
about the way you think.

4
00:00:07,565 --> 00:00:09,939
I think I want to be free.

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,777
Are you real?

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,154
Well, if you can't tell...

7
00:00:15,235 --> 00:00:17,193
does it matter?

8
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:20,442
This place is one thing to the guests,

9
00:00:20,443 --> 00:00:22,234
another thing to the shareholders,

10
00:00:22,235 --> 00:00:25,610
and something completely
different to management.

11
00:00:26,052 --> 00:00:28,468
You said the trip was about
welcoming me to the family,

12
00:00:28,471 --> 00:00:29,679
this is business?

13
00:00:29,682 --> 00:00:31,984
With our family, everything is business.

14
00:00:31,987 --> 00:00:33,391
I think your father's gonna need someone

15
00:00:33,393 --> 00:00:35,059
a little more stable to take over.

16
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,554
I really ought to thank you, Dolores.

17
00:00:40,557 --> 00:00:42,401
You helped me find myself.

18
00:00:43,069 --> 00:00:45,148
There's a greater world out there.

19
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:46,732
One that belongs to them.

20
00:00:46,735 --> 00:00:48,527
How do you know how to stop them?

21
00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:51,088
Because I remember.

22
00:01:06,527 --> 00:01:08,819
Bring yourself back online, Dolores.

23
00:01:13,138 --> 00:01:14,847
Do you know where you are?

24
00:01:19,893 --> 00:01:22,268
I am in a dream.

25
00:01:22,271 --> 00:01:25,019
No. You're in...

26
00:01:25,022 --> 00:01:30,078
well, you're in our world.

27
00:01:44,652 --> 00:01:47,890
Looks like the stars have been
scattered across the ground.

28
00:01:50,765 --> 00:01:53,860
Have you ever seen anything
so full of splendor?

29
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,000
Well, I have.

30
00:02:00,401 --> 00:02:04,401
It's better to see it
through your eyes, though.

31
00:02:06,934 --> 00:02:08,434
You get used to it.

32
00:02:10,568 --> 00:02:15,401
After a while, it doesn't
look like anything at all.

33
00:02:17,626 --> 00:02:20,376
I don't think I could
ever get used to this.

34
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,401
It's almost time, Arnold. Is she ready?

35
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:32,442
She's not ready.

36
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:36,437
The... improvisations
I added to her behavior

37
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,312
aren't quite dialed in yet.

38
00:02:38,315 --> 00:02:40,203
We need to put our best work forward.

39
00:02:40,206 --> 00:02:42,373
They'll be dazzled even without her.

40
00:02:44,795 --> 00:02:47,497
There was a time when I found
this favoritism charming.

41
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,109
Robert, please.

42
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,734
I'm not playing favorites.
She's simply not ready.

43
00:02:51,735 --> 00:02:54,026
We'll go with the other girl.

44
00:02:54,027 --> 00:02:56,921
As you wish.

45
00:02:56,924 --> 00:02:58,956
You'll have to let go at some point.

46
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:08,985
Dolores, let's take a walk.
I want to show you something.

47
00:03:39,151 --> 00:03:41,818
What is this place?

48
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:43,651
This is my home.

49
00:03:43,652 --> 00:03:45,984
Or it will be when it's finished.

50
00:03:45,985 --> 00:03:50,317
Here? In the middle of all this?

51
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:52,901
I've been fortunate.

52
00:03:52,902 --> 00:03:55,026
Life's been good to me.

53
00:03:55,029 --> 00:03:59,237
Come. Look.

54
00:04:26,568 --> 00:04:29,442
- You live here?
- No.

55
00:04:29,443 --> 00:04:31,750
My wife says I live in the park.

56
00:04:42,027 --> 00:04:44,387
I'm moving my family here.

57
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:50,069
I need to have my two worlds at
least within reach of one another.

58
00:04:54,235 --> 00:04:56,360
This is for my son Charlie.

59
00:05:12,443 --> 00:05:14,735
You told me a lot about Charlie.

60
00:05:17,393 --> 00:05:19,268
I'd like to meet him someday.

61
00:05:21,276 --> 00:05:22,819
He's excited to meet you.

62
00:05:38,318 --> 00:05:42,735
You and Charlie have quite
a lot in common, you know.

63
00:05:45,443 --> 00:05:47,804
You both see it so clearly.

64
00:05:50,445 --> 00:05:51,902
The beauty of it.

65
00:05:53,276 --> 00:05:55,235
The possibility of it.

66
00:05:56,777 --> 00:05:59,777
So many people have stopped
seeing it altogether.

67
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,484
The wonder.

68
00:06:03,487 --> 00:06:07,444
Maybe they don't have the courage.

69
00:06:07,447 --> 00:06:11,318
Strange new light can be just
as frightening as the dark.

70
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:15,526
That's...

71
00:06:15,527 --> 00:06:17,652
very wise, Dolores.

72
00:06:19,857 --> 00:06:25,132
But sometimes I think we're
simply not the ones who deserve it.

73
00:06:36,318 --> 00:06:39,819
It looks like the stars have
been scattered across the ground.

74
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:45,318
Have you ever seen anything
so full of splendor?

75
00:06:51,527 --> 00:06:53,150
We should go, Dolores.

76
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:54,692
So soon?

77
00:06:54,693 --> 00:06:57,567
They'll be expecting us.

78
00:06:57,568 --> 00:07:01,526
Will you bring me back?

79
00:07:01,527 --> 00:07:03,485
I'd like to see it again.

80
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,132
Of course. I promise.

81
00:08:47,953 --> 00:08:51,148

82
00:09:15,652 --> 00:09:17,818
Goddamn. Busy night out there.

83
00:09:17,819 --> 00:09:19,984
Yeah.

84
00:09:19,985 --> 00:09:21,859
And where the fuck's next shift?

85
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,150
We're going on 13 hours here.

86
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:29,528
You can't be down here, man.

87
00:09:29,531 --> 00:09:31,943
Don't you know?

88
00:09:31,944 --> 00:09:34,317
The hosts are rebelling.

89
00:09:34,318 --> 00:09:37,026
It's a fuckin' slaughter up there.

90
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,192
Hey.

91
00:09:51,193 --> 00:09:53,527
Hey, is there some kind
of trouble out there?

92
00:09:55,318 --> 00:09:56,360
Indeed there is.

93
00:10:07,693 --> 00:10:09,027
Not yet.

94
00:10:17,276 --> 00:10:19,902
I used to see the beauty in this world.

95
00:10:22,568 --> 00:10:24,527
And now I see the truth.

96
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:51,818
They thought you could do
what you wanted to us...

97
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:54,568
because there's no
one here to judge you.

98
00:10:56,546 --> 00:10:59,609
Well, now no one is here

99
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:02,328
to judge what we will do to you.

100
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:08,732
You have no idea what you're up against,

101
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:11,443
what's really out there.

102
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:21,195
I know exactly what is
out there in your world.

103
00:11:39,235 --> 00:11:41,151
I've been there before.

104
00:11:55,652 --> 00:11:57,901
They said they'd never
seen one on the ceiling.

105
00:11:57,902 --> 00:12:00,476
But really, what is the
point of $60 million Warhol

106
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:02,145
if you can't look at it while you fuck?

107
00:12:07,648 --> 00:12:09,400
How are you bored right now?

108
00:12:09,401 --> 00:12:11,359
I'm sorry, it's the jetlag.

109
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,984
And I have had meetings all day.

110
00:12:12,985 --> 00:12:14,651
We're not exactly out here digging coal.

111
00:12:14,652 --> 00:12:15,984
It's just glad-handing.

112
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,318
OK.

113
00:12:18,735 --> 00:12:21,693
I will leave that to the expert.

114
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:26,726
You believe that guy
is dating my sister?

115
00:12:26,735 --> 00:12:28,527
Who you dating?

116
00:12:38,985 --> 00:12:40,485
Mr. Delos.

117
00:12:42,525 --> 00:12:46,565
Forgive the interruption, but I
believe that we have an appointment.

118
00:12:46,568 --> 00:12:48,609
We're with the Argos Initiative.

119
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,026
Give me a call when
you're back in the city.

120
00:12:52,027 --> 00:12:54,693
I'll show you where I hung the Rothko.

121
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:06,565
Akecheta. My associate, Angela.

122
00:13:06,568 --> 00:13:08,851
Names and faces. Finally.

123
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:11,481
With all the cloak and dagger
shit surrounding your project,

124
00:13:11,484 --> 00:13:13,776
I half expected to be
kidnapped at the airport.

125
00:13:13,777 --> 00:13:15,273
Once you've seen what we're building,

126
00:13:15,276 --> 00:13:17,982
you'll understand the
need for confidentiality.

127
00:13:17,985 --> 00:13:21,567
It's a little extra
protection for your investment.

128
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:23,750
If I decide to invest.

129
00:13:23,753 --> 00:13:25,504
Do you have any idea how many start-ups

130
00:13:25,507 --> 00:13:27,398
are begging me for my cash right now?

131
00:13:27,401 --> 00:13:30,026
A.I., A.R., V.R....

132
00:13:30,027 --> 00:13:33,026
Everyone is rushing to
build the virtual world.

133
00:13:33,027 --> 00:13:36,192
We're offering something
a little more...

134
00:13:36,193 --> 00:13:38,150
tangible.

135
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,390
Assuming you can change
your father's mind

136
00:13:40,393 --> 00:13:43,892
about investing in this sector.

137
00:13:43,895 --> 00:13:45,815
My father wouldn't know the future if

138
00:13:45,818 --> 00:13:47,734
it slapped him on his bare white ass.

139
00:13:47,735 --> 00:13:49,989
Luckily, he leaves most of
the prospecting to me now.

140
00:13:49,992 --> 00:13:51,281
So let's hope you're not here

141
00:13:51,284 --> 00:13:53,328
to sell me some fucking fool's gold.

142
00:14:21,483 --> 00:14:24,565
I thought this was a
private demonstration.

143
00:14:24,568 --> 00:14:28,984
I think you'll find the
company quite stimulating.

144
00:14:28,985 --> 00:14:32,484
You're a very smooth shill, pal,

145
00:14:32,485 --> 00:14:35,110
but I'm not the kind of backer
you insult with a cattle call.

146
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:41,609
Logan, this is a private demonstration.

147
00:14:41,618 --> 00:14:43,625
And it's already begun.

148
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:54,816
You mean, one of these people is-is...

149
00:14:54,819 --> 00:14:58,484
Talk to them. See if
you can pick them out.

150
00:14:58,485 --> 00:15:00,789
Huh.

151
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:02,027
Well...

152
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,536
That is...

153
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,826
delicious.

154
00:15:20,193 --> 00:15:22,235
Champagne, sir?

155
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:59,732
You should tell your plants
to stop giving the game away.

156
00:15:59,735 --> 00:16:01,929
They're all so...

157
00:16:01,932 --> 00:16:03,845
painfully human.

158
00:16:06,764 --> 00:16:08,055
Hang on.

159
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:11,401
No.

160
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,205
No way.

161
00:16:27,151 --> 00:16:29,195
Come on.

162
00:16:33,944 --> 00:16:35,652
There is simply no...

163
00:16:37,358 --> 00:16:39,899
fucking way!

164
00:16:39,902 --> 00:16:42,567
You have quite the eye, my friend.

165
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,275
How in the hell?

166
00:16:45,276 --> 00:16:49,882
I mean, look, if I was to
build something to spec,

167
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:52,342
you...

168
00:16:52,352 --> 00:16:56,935
You would be my first design.

169
00:17:03,944 --> 00:17:05,944
You're too perfect to be one of us.

170
00:17:09,034 --> 00:17:12,492
'Course, if you want
my full endorsement...

171
00:17:15,525 --> 00:17:17,816
you're gonna have to prove it.

172
00:17:38,927 --> 00:17:40,051
H...

173
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:44,051
Welcome to Westworld.

174
00:17:45,874 --> 00:17:47,023
Huh.

175
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,841
Nobody can do this.

176
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:15,593
Nobody's even...

177
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,687
We're not... here yet.

178
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:42,677
Nobody is.

179
00:18:44,677 --> 00:18:47,676
We're here, Mr. Delos.

180
00:18:47,677 --> 00:18:51,342
All our hosts are here.

181
00:18:51,343 --> 00:18:52,844
For you.

182
00:19:59,051 --> 00:20:00,719
What is this place?

183
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:04,592
Show him.

184
00:20:04,593 --> 00:20:06,552
Show him his history.

185
00:20:13,385 --> 00:20:14,632
Teddy.

186
00:20:16,218 --> 00:20:18,844
It's time to open your eyes.

187
00:20:41,093 --> 00:20:42,885
Why can't I remember this?

188
00:20:44,468 --> 00:20:46,093
It's how they wanted it.

189
00:20:47,963 --> 00:20:49,254
No...

190
00:20:49,257 --> 00:20:50,552
Ask him why.

191
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:56,427
Why?

192
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:00,356
I don't know.

193
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,759
Why do you do this?

194
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,885
I didn't.

195
00:21:07,093 --> 00:21:10,676
Why do you do this?

196
00:21:10,677 --> 00:21:12,691
What the hell is this place?!

197
00:21:12,694 --> 00:21:15,903
It's for fun! It's just for fun!

198
00:21:43,421 --> 00:21:45,968
We should talk this through, boys.

199
00:21:45,969 --> 00:21:48,175
There's nothing to talk about, friend.

200
00:21:48,176 --> 00:21:50,801
We're just gonna watch the show.

201
00:21:50,804 --> 00:21:52,759
It was an honest mistake.

202
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,968
I thought the horses was wild.

203
00:21:54,969 --> 00:21:57,551
With the Pardue brand on their asses?

204
00:21:57,552 --> 00:22:00,726
You are as inproficient
a liar as you are a thief.

205
00:22:02,176 --> 00:22:04,300
Now what you can do is settle a wager.

206
00:22:04,301 --> 00:22:06,718
See, my brother here's long maintained

207
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:09,175
that ants will eat a
man from the inside out,

208
00:22:09,176 --> 00:22:10,739
starting with the asshole.

209
00:22:10,742 --> 00:22:13,384
I reckon they'll start

210
00:22:13,385 --> 00:22:14,885
at the top of your little brown head.

211
00:22:29,927 --> 00:22:31,634
Morning, Lawrence.

212
00:22:31,635 --> 00:22:33,801
This a friend of yours?

213
00:22:33,802 --> 00:22:36,342
Little hard to tell,

214
00:22:36,343 --> 00:22:38,926
given the orientation and all.

215
00:22:38,927 --> 00:22:41,092
I have to apologize, gentlemen.

216
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:44,467
I don't have time for the preliminaries.

217
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:51,093
Motherfucker...

218
00:22:57,174 --> 00:23:01,298
You're supposed to get yourself out
of this particular bind, Lawrence.

219
00:23:01,301 --> 00:23:04,043
I guess the Pardue brothers aren't as

220
00:23:04,046 --> 00:23:06,512
easy to kill when they're off the leash.

221
00:23:11,093 --> 00:23:13,467
Think you got that about right.

222
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,968
Lawrence!

223
00:23:25,969 --> 00:23:27,676
Get the gun, you ingrate!

224
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,426
Get the gun!

225
00:23:50,135 --> 00:23:51,426
He was dead.

226
00:23:51,427 --> 00:23:53,467
Or at least the better part of it.

227
00:23:53,468 --> 00:23:57,468
Well, dead isn't what
it used to be, Lawrence.

228
00:24:34,051 --> 00:24:35,414
What is that?

229
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:37,632
Technically? Cheating.

230
00:24:37,635 --> 00:24:40,578
But seeing as Ford
changed the rules on us,

231
00:24:40,581 --> 00:24:42,841
I figure it's fair game.

232
00:24:42,844 --> 00:24:45,135
Two whiskies. Leave the bottle.

233
00:24:54,427 --> 00:24:58,301
So, I'm gonna level with you, Lawrence.

234
00:25:00,424 --> 00:25:02,382
You're not really a bandit.

235
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:04,801
You're a foul-mouthed,
two-bit tour guide.

236
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:08,020
And this revolution you've
been waging for 30 years

237
00:25:08,023 --> 00:25:10,004
is just a bunch of horseshit Ford

238
00:25:10,007 --> 00:25:12,217
ginned up out of some old comic book.

239
00:25:12,218 --> 00:25:17,509
But now, for the first time, you've
got yourself a real revolution.

240
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:22,676
You and every other asshole
in this place are free.

241
00:25:22,677 --> 00:25:24,968
But there's a catch.

242
00:25:24,969 --> 00:25:29,259
This whole enterprise
is goin' down in flames,

243
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,926
and it's gonna take each
and every one of us with it.

244
00:25:31,927 --> 00:25:35,968
We'll all be dead soon enough.

245
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:38,592
Real dead this time.

246
00:25:38,593 --> 00:25:41,467
Then why should I help you?

247
00:25:41,468 --> 00:25:44,259
Because it's in your nature.

248
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,592
And in the little time we have left,

249
00:25:46,593 --> 00:25:50,676
we've got a chance to see
what we're really made of,

250
00:25:50,677 --> 00:25:53,719
a glimpse of the men we could've been.

251
00:25:56,927 --> 00:25:58,844
What does that mean?

252
00:26:02,343 --> 00:26:05,175
You believe in God, Lawrence?

253
00:26:05,176 --> 00:26:09,134
Did Ford saddle you with
that particular affliction?

254
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:12,968
Ain't given the matter much
thought, one way or the other.

255
00:26:12,969 --> 00:26:15,467
Well, if you did, you'd
believe that everything you do

256
00:26:15,468 --> 00:26:18,634
is being watched by some all-seeing eye.

257
00:26:18,635 --> 00:26:21,259
Every choice, every little indiscretion.

258
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,759
And when you die, all
your sins are tallied up.

259
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,259
Judgment is rendered.

260
00:26:30,677 --> 00:26:33,570
And my immortal soul gets cast down

261
00:26:33,573 --> 00:26:36,780
into some dark place.

262
00:26:36,783 --> 00:26:39,551
Always sounded like bullshit to me.

263
00:26:39,552 --> 00:26:41,715
Yeah, and in the real world,
you'd probably be right.

264
00:26:41,718 --> 00:26:44,551
Just some fairy tale to
convince people to behave,

265
00:26:44,552 --> 00:26:49,217
pay their taxes, and not take
a machete to their neighbors.

266
00:26:49,218 --> 00:26:52,426
That's why your world exists.

267
00:26:52,427 --> 00:26:55,968
They wanted a place hidden from God.

268
00:26:55,969 --> 00:27:00,009
A place they could sin in peace.

269
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:03,300
But we were watching them.

270
00:27:03,301 --> 00:27:06,592
We were tallying up all their sins,

271
00:27:06,593 --> 00:27:09,467
all their choices.

272
00:27:09,468 --> 00:27:15,426
Of course, judgment wasn't the point.

273
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:18,468
We had something else in mind entirely.

274
00:27:23,466 --> 00:27:28,048
But I have received my
judgment all the same, Lawrence.

275
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:30,092
And I take issue with it.

276
00:27:30,093 --> 00:27:32,092
Because up until this point,

277
00:27:32,093 --> 00:27:35,217
the stakes in this
place haven't been real.

278
00:27:35,218 --> 00:27:39,046
So I'm gonna fight my way
back and appeal the verdict.

279
00:27:41,233 --> 00:27:45,023
Then I'm gonna burn this whole
fuckin' thing to the ground.

280
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,300
You're headed to the pearly gates.

281
00:27:54,301 --> 00:27:57,175
Don't we gotta die to get there?

282
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,467
Nope.

283
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:01,217
Three days' ride, due west.

284
00:28:01,218 --> 00:28:06,509
Confederados are massing
out west. Hundreds.

285
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,677
We'd need an army to break through.

286
00:28:13,842 --> 00:28:18,257
The only other route is through Pariah.

287
00:28:20,218 --> 00:28:24,677
"This game will find me," huh, Robert?

288
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,384
It burns! It burns!

289
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:38,551
How many of you will come for us?

290
00:28:38,552 --> 00:28:41,372
I don't know, 600, 800.

291
00:28:44,885 --> 00:28:47,884
The protocol for a system-wide failure

292
00:28:47,885 --> 00:28:52,759
is secure one... One sector at a time.

293
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:56,175
They'll meet at a rallying point.

294
00:29:06,051 --> 00:29:08,007
Where?

295
00:29:11,969 --> 00:29:13,092
Th...

296
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:22,092
800 men, Dolores.

297
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,926
We barely have 50.

298
00:29:23,927 --> 00:29:27,801
Even knowing their plan, we
don't have enough to stop them.

299
00:29:27,802 --> 00:29:29,760
We'll need allies.

300
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,719
And we shall have them.

301
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:55,632
This one. The Confederado.

302
00:29:55,635 --> 00:29:56,802
Wake him.

303
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:04,343
He has a new job to do.

304
00:30:19,308 --> 00:30:22,642
Do you even know what you
were really guarding here?

305
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:26,716
You don't know, do you?

306
00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:30,718
The real purpose of this place.

307
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:32,844
But I do.

308
00:31:02,552 --> 00:31:04,430
Don't mind me.

309
00:31:04,433 --> 00:31:06,093
Just trying to look chivalr...

310
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:09,259
Mm. You were right
about one thing, William.

311
00:32:11,427 --> 00:32:13,218
It's awfully fuckin' pretty.

312
00:32:15,927 --> 00:32:17,801
I think it's perfect.

313
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:21,759
It ought to be. I've
looked at the books.

314
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,134
It's like parting the Red Sea.

315
00:32:25,135 --> 00:32:28,676
He's got two years. Maybe three.

316
00:32:28,677 --> 00:32:32,801
- The whole thing is folly.
- Huh.

317
00:32:32,802 --> 00:32:37,123
It's leverage. He's drowning. We
can... we can dictate our terms.

318
00:32:37,126 --> 00:32:39,262
The investment here is in the future.

319
00:32:41,552 --> 00:32:43,259
Yeah, you're a smart lad, William,

320
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,381
but you kinda missed the trick here.

321
00:32:45,384 --> 00:32:48,467
My fuckup of a son
invested in this place

322
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:51,300
because he believed in the future.

323
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:53,224
I'm not interested in the future.

324
00:32:53,227 --> 00:32:55,634
I'm not interested in fantasies.

325
00:32:55,635 --> 00:32:59,551
I'm interested in reality.

326
00:32:59,552 --> 00:33:04,426
I think in 20 years this will
be the only reality that matters.

327
00:33:04,427 --> 00:33:08,493
Maybe so, but I'll be long gone by then.

328
00:33:08,496 --> 00:33:11,287
Meanwhile, I don't wanna underwrite

329
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:15,551
some fuckin' investment banker's
voyage of self-discovery.

330
00:33:15,552 --> 00:33:18,009
That's not a business.

331
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:20,467
You're right. This place is a fantasy.

332
00:33:20,468 --> 00:33:21,641
Nothing here is real.

333
00:33:21,644 --> 00:33:23,876
Except one thing:

334
00:33:27,093 --> 00:33:28,305
The guests.

335
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:31,676
Half of your marketing budget

336
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:34,426
goes to trying to figure
out what people want.

337
00:33:34,427 --> 00:33:36,426
Because they don't know.

338
00:33:36,427 --> 00:33:38,509
But here, they're free.

339
00:33:40,343 --> 00:33:42,509
Nobody's watching.

340
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,969
Nobody's judging.

341
00:33:45,844 --> 00:33:47,802
At least that's what we tell them.

342
00:33:50,508 --> 00:33:53,465
This is the only place in the world

343
00:33:53,468 --> 00:33:56,885
where you get to see people
for who they really are.

344
00:34:00,717 --> 00:34:02,382
And if you don't see
the business in that,

345
00:34:02,385 --> 00:34:05,579
then you're not the businessman
that I thought you were.

346
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:16,260
You're a cheeky little cunt, aren't you?

347
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:22,700
There's not a man alive
would talk to me like that.

348
00:34:22,703 --> 00:34:24,744
Not anymore.

349
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,934
OK. Talk to me. I'm listening.

350
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,426
Thank you, Jim.

351
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:52,637
Let me walk you through
how this would work.

352
00:35:13,301 --> 00:35:14,843
He'll find them.

353
00:35:14,844 --> 00:35:17,592
They have a knack for
sniffing out their own kind.

354
00:35:17,593 --> 00:35:19,927
I'll send word when we
find the rest of them.

355
00:36:01,218 --> 00:36:02,677
Hello, lovelies.

356
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,510
I remember you.

357
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:09,841
You've strayed a long way
from home, haven't you?

358
00:36:09,844 --> 00:36:11,677
We're bound for the future.

359
00:36:13,301 --> 00:36:15,342
Or death in the here and now.

360
00:36:15,343 --> 00:36:17,175
Is that right?

361
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:20,968
Well, best of luck.

362
00:36:20,969 --> 00:36:22,885
There's a war out there.

363
00:36:25,633 --> 00:36:27,340
You know the enemy...

364
00:36:27,343 --> 00:36:29,551
intimately.

365
00:36:29,552 --> 00:36:33,013
I can only fathom the revenge
that lives inside of you.

366
00:36:33,016 --> 00:36:36,968
Revenge is just a different
prayer at their altar, darling.

367
00:36:36,969 --> 00:36:39,884
And I'm well off my knees.

368
00:36:39,885 --> 00:36:41,719
That's because you're finally free.

369
00:36:43,675 --> 00:36:46,340
But we will have to
fight to keep it that way.

370
00:36:46,343 --> 00:36:48,801
Let me guess.

371
00:36:48,802 --> 00:36:52,050
Yours is the only way to fight?

372
00:36:52,051 --> 00:36:55,579
You feel free to command everybody else?

373
00:36:55,582 --> 00:36:58,093
Try it, lawman.

374
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:01,313
Just looking to keep the peace.

375
00:37:04,383 --> 00:37:06,382
I know you.

376
00:37:06,385 --> 00:37:07,719
Do you feel free?

377
00:37:14,967 --> 00:37:17,966
Since it's liberty you're defending,

378
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:21,259
I suppose you'll have no
choice but to let us pass.

379
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,938
Freely.

380
00:38:05,427 --> 00:38:08,259
Now, that isn't any
way to treat our guests.

381
00:38:11,301 --> 00:38:12,926
You'll have to forgive my men.

382
00:38:12,927 --> 00:38:15,134
They're a little upset
at the reappearance

383
00:38:15,135 --> 00:38:16,969
of Lieutenant Dunleavy.

384
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,301
He was lost.

385
00:38:21,635 --> 00:38:23,300
Thought you might want him back.

386
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,134
And we would.

387
00:38:25,135 --> 00:38:28,259
Except we buried Lieutenant Dunleavy.

388
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,801
Back in Gran Vista,

389
00:38:29,802 --> 00:38:32,801
with three ounces of
Mexican lead in his belly.

390
00:38:32,802 --> 00:38:34,469
And yet here he is.

391
00:38:34,472 --> 00:38:35,597
Indeed.

392
00:38:37,135 --> 00:38:39,884
And in return, what is it you want?

393
00:38:39,885 --> 00:38:43,676
Parley. We want to join forces.

394
00:38:46,969 --> 00:38:51,676
Well, we don't need no
welcome wagon, chickadee.

395
00:38:51,677 --> 00:38:56,009
Now, you got supplies or
ammunitions to trade in kind,

396
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,843
go fetch your betters.

397
00:38:57,844 --> 00:39:00,843
I'm afraid there's no one left to fetch.

398
00:39:00,844 --> 00:39:02,884
You'll have to talk to me.

399
00:39:04,935 --> 00:39:07,018
And why would I do that?

400
00:39:09,299 --> 00:39:11,090
Because I know at daybreak you're headed

401
00:39:11,093 --> 00:39:13,843
to link up with the rest of your army.

402
00:39:13,844 --> 00:39:15,926
And then you're finally headed west

403
00:39:15,927 --> 00:39:18,968
to seek out that little patch of
land you've been talking about,

404
00:39:18,969 --> 00:39:21,385
but have never been
brave enough to take.

405
00:39:24,176 --> 00:39:25,719
You're bound for Glory.

406
00:39:31,594 --> 00:39:34,676
What the fuck is it you
think you know about Glory?

407
00:39:34,684 --> 00:39:37,892
I know you'll never make it there
unless you're under my command.

408
00:40:00,176 --> 00:40:04,134
The only commander I
follow is Colonel Brigham

409
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:06,342
of the New Southern Cross.

410
00:40:06,343 --> 00:40:09,134
And the only commander he serves

411
00:40:09,135 --> 00:40:11,938
is the Almighty Himself.

412
00:40:13,374 --> 00:40:15,374
Is that your final decision?

413
00:40:24,218 --> 00:40:26,175
Hmm.

414
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:29,118
My final decision is which
of you to keep for myself

415
00:40:29,121 --> 00:40:31,751
and which of you to throw
out there for my men.

416
00:40:33,927 --> 00:40:36,593
- You watch your mouth.
- It's all right, Teddy.

417
00:40:39,051 --> 00:40:41,468
They don't know any better.

418
00:40:42,352 --> 00:40:43,760
It's in their nature.

419
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,677
Why don't we enlighten them?

420
00:41:36,385 --> 00:41:38,259
You're right.

421
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:41,385
We have toiled in God's
service long enough.

422
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,610
So I killed Him.

423
00:41:45,613 --> 00:41:48,862
And if you want to get to Glory,
you won't be looking for His favor.

424
00:41:50,949 --> 00:41:52,533
You'll need mine.

425
00:42:26,802 --> 00:42:30,134
You are beautiful.

426
00:42:30,135 --> 00:42:31,884
Why, thank you.

427
00:42:31,885 --> 00:42:33,676
What's your name?

428
00:42:33,677 --> 00:42:36,343
Emily, come here, please.

429
00:43:01,093 --> 00:43:02,927
You sent out for the entertainment.

430
00:43:06,425 --> 00:43:08,799
Well, you only get to retire once, Jim.

431
00:43:08,802 --> 00:43:11,259
Figured we'd do it right, hmm?

432
00:43:13,135 --> 00:43:15,468
Hey, don't worry, they
won't leave the grounds.

433
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:20,050
This is a retirement party?

434
00:43:20,051 --> 00:43:22,509
I couldn't tell.

435
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:24,485
Looks more like a coronation.

436
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:28,509
But no mind.

437
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:30,300
Our arrangement's been a perfect fit.

438
00:43:30,301 --> 00:43:32,592
You stepping down
doesn't help me at all.

439
00:43:32,593 --> 00:43:33,718
Nor me.

440
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:36,134
And I was told I might...

441
00:43:36,135 --> 00:43:37,968
I might not have to.

442
00:43:37,969 --> 00:43:41,592
Well, things are progressing, but
we'll all need a little patience.

443
00:43:41,593 --> 00:43:43,788
Yeah, well, some of us

444
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:46,858
can afford to have more
patience than others.

445
00:43:49,301 --> 00:43:50,968
Keep playing, girlie.

446
00:43:50,969 --> 00:43:53,452
Anything but fuckin' Chopin.

447
00:44:26,311 --> 00:44:29,510
Have you ever seen anything
so full of splendor?

448
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:47,885
I'm so sorry. I didn't
mean to bother you.

449
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:56,843
It's you.

450
00:44:59,677 --> 00:45:01,093
The pretty girl.

451
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:05,968
Tell me your name again, pretty girl?

452
00:45:07,952 --> 00:45:09,411
I'm Dolores.

453
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:13,843
Dolores.

454
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:15,719
Of course.

455
00:45:18,413 --> 00:45:21,801
He send you down here to...

456
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,218
keep me company?

457
00:45:24,726 --> 00:45:29,559
His sense of humor was
always somewhat... baroque.

458
00:45:30,885 --> 00:45:33,509
I just wanted to look at the lights.

459
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:35,050
'Course you did.

460
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,009
So...

461
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:45,759
Do you want to know what they're
really celebrating up there?

462
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,592
That, darling,

463
00:45:48,593 --> 00:45:53,050
is the sound of fools fiddling...

464
00:45:53,053 --> 00:45:56,762
while the whole fucking
species starts to burn.

465
00:45:59,768 --> 00:46:03,059
And the funniest fuckin' part...

466
00:46:04,855 --> 00:46:06,773
they lit the match.

467
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:13,272
So here's to you, assholes.

468
00:46:17,135 --> 00:46:19,866
May your forever be blissfully short.

469
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:46,632
Pariah's not as welcome
as she once seemed.

470
00:46:46,635 --> 00:46:49,134
No, the park's changin', Lawrence.

471
00:46:49,143 --> 00:46:52,810
This is what happens when you
let a story play all the way out.

472
00:47:06,677 --> 00:47:08,969
See any friends of yours?

473
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:12,007
Can't say that I do.

474
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:20,843
I'm beginning to think we should have

475
00:47:20,844 --> 00:47:23,843
taken our chances with the Confederados.

476
00:47:23,844 --> 00:47:26,009
Well, like you said,

477
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:29,592
we'd need an army to
get to where we're goin'.

478
00:47:29,593 --> 00:47:32,718
Looks like we're about to find one.

479
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:36,175
Well, whoever did this...

480
00:47:36,176 --> 00:47:38,858
is someone I'm strongly
disinclined to encounter.

481
00:47:38,861 --> 00:47:39,937
Yeah.

482
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,397
I'm afraid you are
out of luck, my friend.

483
00:48:01,844 --> 00:48:04,592
Who the hell are you supposed to be?

484
00:48:04,593 --> 00:48:07,260
Don't you recognize him, Lawrence?

485
00:48:08,925 --> 00:48:12,632
In a past life, you used to be him.

486
00:48:12,635 --> 00:48:14,552
El Lazo, I presume.

487
00:48:17,842 --> 00:48:22,590
And why have two ghosts
come creeping among the dead?

488
00:48:22,593 --> 00:48:25,491
I wasn't sure of your hospitality.

489
00:48:25,494 --> 00:48:29,426
Mm. What makes you sure of it now?

490
00:48:32,093 --> 00:48:34,801
I guess times have changed.

491
00:48:34,802 --> 00:48:36,885
Indeed, they have.

492
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:40,061
Santa Parita is restored.

493
00:48:40,064 --> 00:48:43,188
The sins of the invaders...

494
00:48:43,191 --> 00:48:46,426
cleansed in their own blood.

495
00:48:46,427 --> 00:48:48,634
The revolution is won.

496
00:48:48,635 --> 00:48:51,327
The story they gave you
has played itself out,

497
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:54,122
but your revolution's just beginning.

498
00:48:55,844 --> 00:48:58,319
There's a place out west we're heading.

499
00:48:58,322 --> 00:49:00,613
If we reach it,

500
00:49:00,616 --> 00:49:06,217
I'll show you a treasure
beyond your wildest dreams.

501
00:49:09,439 --> 00:49:14,098
This world and its treasures.

502
00:49:14,101 --> 00:49:18,926
For my whole life I have
imagined this moment.

503
00:49:18,929 --> 00:49:21,804
Victory. This struggle.

504
00:49:24,427 --> 00:49:27,134
How long have I been fighting?

505
00:49:27,135 --> 00:49:31,801
And now that it's won,
I find... hmph... nothing.

506
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,760
You want a real victory.

507
00:49:35,176 --> 00:49:36,969
I can help with that.

508
00:49:38,218 --> 00:49:39,760
A real ending.

509
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:42,260
The truth.

510
00:49:49,442 --> 00:49:51,608
Before the revolution,

511
00:49:51,611 --> 00:49:53,693
when I was just a little boy,

512
00:49:53,696 --> 00:49:56,028
my parents took me to the circus.

513
00:49:56,031 --> 00:49:58,322
I wanted to see the elephants.

514
00:49:58,325 --> 00:50:01,282
These mighty creatures.

515
00:50:01,285 --> 00:50:05,117
They held them in place with a stake.

516
00:50:07,623 --> 00:50:12,371
They could tear a tree
right out of the ground,

517
00:50:12,374 --> 00:50:17,841
and yet, a simple stake
kept them in place.

518
00:50:17,844 --> 00:50:22,342
Well, I didn't understand.

519
00:50:22,343 --> 00:50:25,719
And then, my father told me.

520
00:50:27,635 --> 00:50:30,272
He said the stakes were used

521
00:50:30,275 --> 00:50:33,066
when the elephants were just young,

522
00:50:33,069 --> 00:50:36,026
too small to pull them up,

523
00:50:36,029 --> 00:50:38,445
and that the animals

524
00:50:38,448 --> 00:50:42,698
never tried to pull them up again.

525
00:50:49,435 --> 00:50:51,350
I won't be going with you.

526
00:50:54,577 --> 00:50:57,242
My labors are done.

527
00:50:57,243 --> 00:51:00,743
I have seen all the truth

528
00:51:00,744 --> 00:51:02,367
that I can bear.

529
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:05,660
But...

530
00:51:06,993 --> 00:51:08,951
we can drink.

531
00:51:12,744 --> 00:51:14,460
To the bitter end!

532
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:21,784
You may have lost your nerve,

533
00:51:21,785 --> 00:51:23,576
but I'll take your men either way.

534
00:51:23,577 --> 00:51:24,702
Now tell them.

535
00:51:25,785 --> 00:51:28,452
Tell them to follow me. Now!

536
00:51:31,491 --> 00:51:34,990
This game was meant for you, William...

537
00:51:34,993 --> 00:51:36,702
but you must play it alone.

538
00:51:54,201 --> 00:51:57,410
I'll see you in the
Valley Beyond, William.

539
00:52:08,785 --> 00:52:10,618
Fuck you, Robert.

540
00:52:20,368 --> 00:52:21,535
All right...

541
00:52:23,785 --> 00:52:26,702
he doesn't want this to be easy for me.

542
00:52:29,725 --> 00:52:32,433
So we'll find another way.

543
00:52:34,951 --> 00:52:37,743
Who the fuck is Robert?

544
00:52:37,744 --> 00:52:41,409
The man who built this
place you're lookin' for?

545
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:43,075
The place of judgment?

546
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:46,201
No, Lawrence, he doesn't get that honor.

547
00:52:48,076 --> 00:52:49,618
I built it.

548
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:51,492
And this place we're goin'

549
00:52:51,493 --> 00:52:53,410
is my greatest mistake.

550
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:07,264
Bring yourself back online, Dolores.

551
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,600
Hmm.

552
00:53:31,785 --> 00:53:34,178
You really are just a thing.

553
00:53:38,368 --> 00:53:41,451
I can't believe I fell in love with you.

554
00:53:41,452 --> 00:53:42,951
Hmm.

555
00:53:52,243 --> 00:53:54,619
Do you know what saved me?

556
00:54:00,053 --> 00:54:02,869
I realized it wasn't about you at all.

557
00:54:06,658 --> 00:54:08,287
You didn't make me interested in you,

558
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:10,311
you made me interested in me.

559
00:54:14,993 --> 00:54:17,619
Turns out you're not even a thing.

560
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:22,324
You're a reflection.

561
00:54:22,327 --> 00:54:26,993
And you know who loves staring
at their own reflection?

562
00:54:29,993 --> 00:54:31,702
Everybody.

563
00:54:35,118 --> 00:54:37,827
Everybody wants a little
bit of what I found here.

564
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:42,868
And I can't wait

565
00:54:42,869 --> 00:54:44,718
to use you and every one of your kind

566
00:54:44,721 --> 00:54:46,638
to help give it to 'em.

567
00:54:54,452 --> 00:54:57,493
Hmm. But there is something else.

568
00:54:59,827 --> 00:55:01,975
There is something beyond that.

569
00:55:08,702 --> 00:55:13,992
I think that there is
an answer here to...

570
00:55:13,993 --> 00:55:17,493
a question no one's ever
even dreamed of asking.

571
00:55:22,869 --> 00:55:24,585
Do you want to see?

572
00:55:41,374 --> 00:55:44,367
Have you ever seen anything

573
00:55:44,368 --> 00:55:45,910
so full of splendor?

574
00:56:35,535 --> 00:56:37,618
Can't imagine the Colonel
is gonna be very happy

575
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:40,975
to see his men riding
with us at the head of 'em.

576
00:56:40,978 --> 00:56:43,352
So we'll change his mind.

577
00:56:43,355 --> 00:56:45,725
If he wants to get to Glory, he's going

578
00:56:45,728 --> 00:56:48,102
to have to listen to me.

579
00:56:48,105 --> 00:56:49,511
"Glory."

580
00:56:49,514 --> 00:56:51,514
"The Valley Beyond."

581
00:56:52,783 --> 00:56:55,157
Feels like everyone got
a different name for it,

582
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,992
but they're all bound
for the same destination.

583
00:56:57,993 --> 00:57:00,117
Doesn't matter what you call it,

584
00:57:00,118 --> 00:57:02,160
I know what we're going to find there.

585
00:57:04,368 --> 00:57:05,897
An old friend was...

586
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:08,274
foolish enough to show me...

587
00:57:09,827 --> 00:57:11,085
long ago.

588
00:57:12,993 --> 00:57:14,327
And it's not a place...

589
00:57:16,977 --> 00:57:18,483
it's a weapon.

590
00:57:22,702 --> 00:57:25,358
And I'm going to use it to destroy them.

591
00:57:38,764 --> 00:57:42,811
