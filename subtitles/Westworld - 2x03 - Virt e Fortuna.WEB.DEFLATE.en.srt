1
00:00:03,258 --> 00:00:04,925
You waitin' up for me, Daddy?

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,216
I'm gonna help Momma put supper on.

3
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:10,050
What're you uploading?

4
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:11,258
Is it the host of codes?

5
00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:13,131
As of this moment, that
doesn't concern you.

6
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:15,758
What does concern you is
getting him on the train,

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,760
out of the park.

8
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:19,424
They were expecting a delivery
from us to the main land.

9
00:00:19,508 --> 00:00:21,256
Until they get it, we
can all forget about

10
00:00:21,258 --> 00:00:23,008
seeing any rescue planes.

11
00:00:23,307 --> 00:00:24,842
I'm going to find my daughter.

12
00:00:25,174 --> 00:00:26,341
Where is she?

13
00:00:26,424 --> 00:00:27,466
Out there.

14
00:00:27,574 --> 00:00:30,216
But, I don't think the odds
are going to be in our favor.

15
00:00:31,842 --> 00:00:33,341
How many of you will come for us?

16
00:00:33,424 --> 00:00:35,473
I don't know. Six hundred, 800.

17
00:00:35,694 --> 00:00:38,633
We wanna join forces.
You're bound for glory.

18
00:00:39,341 --> 00:00:41,784
You'll never make it there
unless you're under my command.

19
00:00:43,174 --> 00:00:45,037
We've got Bengals in Park 6.

20
00:00:45,133 --> 00:00:47,508
We've never had a stray
cross park borders.

21
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,861
Do you mind if I join you?

22
00:02:01,071 --> 00:02:02,633
Do you as you please.

23
00:02:10,424 --> 00:02:13,041
So, what brings you to
this part of the world?

24
00:02:13,585 --> 00:02:15,627
I have a little time to kill...

25
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:18,046
among other things.

26
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:21,049
Hunting.

27
00:02:22,424 --> 00:02:23,802
Bengals?

28
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,054
Yeah, me too.

29
00:02:26,663 --> 00:02:28,174
There's nothing like it, is there?

30
00:02:28,707 --> 00:02:31,498
Edge of the park, a bit... mad.

31
00:02:31,899 --> 00:02:33,411
A bit dangerous.

32
00:02:34,008 --> 00:02:35,798
Sir, the governor wishes

33
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,508
to extend to you an invitation to...

34
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,522
Please tell the governor another time.

35
00:02:39,524 --> 00:02:40,691
I'm quite happy here.

36
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,911
They really don't want us
talking to each other, do they?

37
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,998
Maybe they're trying to steer
you towards a sure thing.

38
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,008
Maybe I miss taking my chances.

39
00:03:16,092 --> 00:03:18,899
You certainly look like one
of the park's offerings.

40
00:03:20,405 --> 00:03:21,953
I promise you,

41
00:03:22,414 --> 00:03:23,733
I'm quite real.

42
00:03:33,188 --> 00:03:35,589
You think the park would go to the
trouble of having one of them

43
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,550
pretend to be one of us?

44
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:42,214
I wouldn't put it past them.

45
00:04:11,383 --> 00:04:13,645
The simplest way to know for sure.

46
00:04:14,473 --> 00:04:16,264
Unless you'd rather not.

47
00:04:16,908 --> 00:04:18,917
Well, it wouldn't be my first time.

48
00:04:21,936 --> 00:04:23,213
It just...

49
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,716
it seems a little excessive.

50
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,383
Perhaps. But I want you to want this.

51
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:36,351
I assure you I do.

52
00:04:36,434 --> 00:04:38,097
Not if you're one of them.

53
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,090
If you're one of them, you
don't know what you want.

54
00:04:40,092 --> 00:04:41,424
You just do as you're told.

55
00:04:41,508 --> 00:04:44,050
For a lot of people,
that is half the fun.

56
00:04:46,591 --> 00:04:47,883
Not for me.

57
00:04:58,508 --> 00:05:00,301
Don't worry.

58
00:05:00,385 --> 00:05:02,301
If you are who you say you are,

59
00:05:02,384 --> 00:05:03,925
this will only sting a bit.

60
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:06,993
And if you're not...

61
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:09,216
you won't remember, anyway.

62
00:05:09,299 --> 00:05:11,299
Still, I'd really rather...

63
00:05:31,693 --> 00:05:32,985
Ahhh.

64
00:05:35,552 --> 00:05:37,164
Congratulations.

65
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:41,967
Ohh.

66
00:05:48,194 --> 00:05:49,674
Now...

67
00:05:50,857 --> 00:05:52,427
where were we?

68
00:06:45,815 --> 00:06:47,971
Have these put in my
tent with our things.

69
00:06:47,973 --> 00:06:49,051
Yes, sir.

70
00:07:06,054 --> 00:07:07,054
Thank you.

71
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:26,341
What do you say to a night off...

72
00:07:26,424 --> 00:07:29,257
before we go hunt the wicked
tiger in the morning?

73
00:07:30,424 --> 00:07:31,985
Something's wrong.

74
00:07:34,172 --> 00:07:35,838
Where is everybody?

75
00:07:40,686 --> 00:07:42,811
Normally, there are other hosts here.

76
00:07:44,716 --> 00:07:46,982
You know, to entertain
us, to... to cook.

77
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:49,211
Well, maybe they're
giving us our privacy.

78
00:07:50,591 --> 00:07:52,214
That's not how this works.

79
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,989
Wow. A new twist in the narrative.

80
00:08:20,092 --> 00:08:22,883
- Horror.
- No. I... I...

81
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:25,258
These violent delights
have violent ends.

82
00:08:25,816 --> 00:08:26,873
Ganju.

83
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,794
Ganju, put the gun down.

84
00:08:31,361 --> 00:08:32,879
Put the gun down, Ganju!

85
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:35,216
Don't worry. He can't hurt us.

86
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:37,675
No, those people are guests. I
rode the train with them on the...

87
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,291
Fuck.

88
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:51,633
Attention.

89
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,050
You have reached the boundary

90
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:54,550
of the guest experience area.

91
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:58,341
Please turn back. Please turn back.

92
00:09:58,424 --> 00:09:59,424
Attention.

93
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:00,675
You have reached the boundary

94
00:10:00,758 --> 00:10:02,550
of the guest experience area.

95
00:10:02,633 --> 00:10:06,008
Please turn back. Please turn back.

96
00:10:06,092 --> 00:10:07,174
Attention.

97
00:10:07,258 --> 00:10:08,383
You have reached the boundary

98
00:10:08,466 --> 00:10:10,008
of the guest experience area.

99
00:10:10,092 --> 00:10:13,591
Please turn back. Please turn back.

100
00:10:13,675 --> 00:10:14,675
Attention.

101
00:10:14,758 --> 00:10:15,842
You have reached the boundary

102
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:17,925
of the guest experience area.

103
00:10:29,424 --> 00:10:31,133
Fuck.

104
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:15,479
<b><font color="#ff0000">Sync and corrections by btsix
www.addic7ed.com</font></b>

105
00:12:35,008 --> 00:12:36,776
Got the go-ahead from recon.

106
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,925
We're clear to enter, but
it's a fuckin' mess.

107
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,133
System's totally down,
including sim-munitions.

108
00:12:41,216 --> 00:12:43,550
Floors 42 through 45 are still on fire.

109
00:12:43,633 --> 00:12:45,299
Someone took out the Cradle.

110
00:12:45,383 --> 00:12:47,177
It's a slaughterhouse in there, sir.

111
00:13:13,383 --> 00:13:14,786
Bernard.

112
00:13:15,258 --> 00:13:16,967
You made it out alive.

113
00:13:19,457 --> 00:13:21,251
Didn't think you had it in you.

114
00:13:22,293 --> 00:13:24,320
What the hell took you guys so long?

115
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,008
We've been pushing across the park.

116
00:13:26,092 --> 00:13:28,383
Securing it one sector at a time.

117
00:13:28,466 --> 00:13:29,801
Did you bring me what I asked for?

118
00:13:30,883 --> 00:13:32,424
No luck yet.

119
00:13:32,508 --> 00:13:35,466
I've had teams in the Mesa
scrub each and every floor.

120
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,133
No luck there, either.

121
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:40,995
What about you, Bernard?

122
00:13:42,716 --> 00:13:45,858
Do you have any idea where Peter
Abernathy might have gone?

123
00:13:49,325 --> 00:13:51,867
He seems to keep slipping away from us.

124
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:09,674
How are we doing?

125
00:14:12,591 --> 00:14:13,970
According to this,

126
00:14:14,434 --> 00:14:18,184
ten hours ago he was somewhere over...

127
00:14:20,466 --> 00:14:21,842
...there.

128
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,695
There he is.

129
00:14:49,172 --> 00:14:50,615
How are we gonna do this?

130
00:14:53,451 --> 00:14:55,288
These assholes comin', or what?

131
00:14:55,378 --> 00:14:56,929
Been two fuckin' hours.

132
00:14:57,038 --> 00:14:59,807
Confederados ain't gonna pass me up.

133
00:15:00,469 --> 00:15:02,186
Fifteen bucks a head.

134
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,978
Nine times.

135
00:15:05,675 --> 00:15:06,798
How much is that?

136
00:15:07,383 --> 00:15:09,758
Enough that we'll be
shittin' in high cotton.

137
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,866
But there's ten of 'em there.

138
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,008
Well, I reckon I might just keep one.

139
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:20,008
See, now that we've had
us a few handsome trades

140
00:15:20,092 --> 00:15:22,452
in our new line of business,

141
00:15:22,535 --> 00:15:27,393
I figure it's high time I
enjoy my own merchandise.

142
00:15:28,006 --> 00:15:30,092
I reckon this one

143
00:15:30,174 --> 00:15:32,340
might make a fine

144
00:15:32,423 --> 00:15:35,050
all-purpose fancy fulfiller.

145
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:37,508
Huh?

146
00:15:37,591 --> 00:15:39,258
Help!

147
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,666
Help!

148
00:15:45,675 --> 00:15:47,230
You stay here.

149
00:15:47,352 --> 00:15:48,785
Watch our wares.

150
00:15:49,466 --> 00:15:54,383
Split up. Whoever finds her
gets the whole 15 she's worth.

151
00:16:04,642 --> 00:16:05,851
Psst!

152
00:16:09,341 --> 00:16:11,504
Well, I'll say,

153
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:15,800
you are gonna fetch me
far more than 15 bu...

154
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:27,424
Network's down,

155
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:30,633
but I can hard port in and give
him a little attitude adjustment.

156
00:16:45,967 --> 00:16:47,373
Let's make you...

157
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:51,967
the most virtuous,

158
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,299
quickest gun in the West.

159
00:17:03,508 --> 00:17:06,092
You the sick tug mistreatin'
these gentlewomen?

160
00:17:06,174 --> 00:17:07,633
What the fuck are you talkin'...

161
00:17:09,174 --> 00:17:10,383
Y'all too?

162
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,758
You only ever touch a woman

163
00:17:16,842 --> 00:17:19,716
as gently as with the petal of a rose.

164
00:17:21,716 --> 00:17:24,058
Any more'n that makes you a coward.

165
00:17:25,203 --> 00:17:26,971
Hey, it's OK.

166
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,041
I won't let them harm you.

167
00:17:30,118 --> 00:17:32,619
Go on. You're free now.

168
00:17:39,008 --> 00:17:40,424
What the fuck?

169
00:17:40,508 --> 00:17:42,633
That's our goddamn merchandise!

170
00:17:42,716 --> 00:17:44,180
I need to get to the train.

171
00:17:44,716 --> 00:17:46,265
I need to get to the train.

172
00:17:46,572 --> 00:17:47,640
I need to get to the tr...

173
00:17:47,723 --> 00:17:49,393
I can help you...

174
00:17:49,476 --> 00:17:50,716
get to your train.

175
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:54,590
Just follow me.

176
00:17:57,092 --> 00:17:59,050
Ah, ya let 'em go.

177
00:18:01,008 --> 00:18:02,424
We had a deal.

178
00:18:02,508 --> 00:18:04,299
I can't abide.

179
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,967
It ain't no good.

180
00:18:06,494 --> 00:18:08,424
I'm just heedin' my convictions.

181
00:18:23,842 --> 00:18:26,330
Wait! Peril rolls through these hills!

182
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:28,899
- I'll escort you, keep you safe!
- Get away from me!

183
00:18:28,976 --> 00:18:30,758
Let's go! C'mon!

184
00:18:31,925 --> 00:18:33,758
Hey. We have to go.

185
00:18:33,842 --> 00:18:35,648
They're coming for us.

186
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:38,833
And leave these mongrels to scourge
our land and our dignity?!

187
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,236
I will not.

188
00:18:40,737 --> 00:18:43,781
I will stand in defiance.

189
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,660
Fight, even if it costs me my life.

♪ Mine eyes have seen the glory ♪

191
00:18:50,842 --> 00:18:53,546

00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,675
Oh, for fuck's sake.

195
00:18:58,758 --> 00:19:00,216
Let's just cut off his head and go.

196
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:03,412

Ohh!

Go.

200
00:19:10,341 --> 00:19:11,466
Get her!

201
00:19:13,758 --> 00:19:15,133
Yah!

202
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:19,099
Don't move.

203
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:25,970
Ready... aim... fire!

204
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,263
Ready...

205
00:19:30,707 --> 00:19:32,971
aim... fire!

206
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,303
Ready...

207
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:39,591
aim... fire!

208
00:19:52,728 --> 00:19:54,728
Shoulder arms!

209
00:20:04,883 --> 00:20:06,113
Quite the welcome.

210
00:20:06,597 --> 00:20:11,429
Major, why is this flaxen
plum ridin' ahead of you?

211
00:20:11,506 --> 00:20:13,204
Because he know what's best for him.

212
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:16,232
And you are?

213
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:18,032
Call me Wyatt.

214
00:20:18,349 --> 00:20:19,627
You're Wyatt?

215
00:20:20,258 --> 00:20:22,842
Colonel, she says we got an enemy comin'

216
00:20:22,925 --> 00:20:26,383
intent on keepin' us from marchin'
for Glory in the mornin'.

217
00:20:26,466 --> 00:20:27,967
Your major's right.

218
00:20:29,011 --> 00:20:31,487
In the morning they'll
be coming from the east,

219
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,092
right over there.

220
00:20:33,975 --> 00:20:35,835
And why should I believe you?

221
00:21:08,424 --> 00:21:10,052
My soldiers are fearless.

222
00:21:10,842 --> 00:21:12,288
They follow my command.

223
00:21:13,508 --> 00:21:15,666
Combined with your army, Colonel,

224
00:21:16,751 --> 00:21:19,383
we won't just survive the
forces riding against us,

225
00:21:19,741 --> 00:21:21,119
we'll crush them.

226
00:21:23,591 --> 00:21:25,735
And that's the kind of solider
that's coming for us...

227
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:27,192
In droves.

228
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,369
What the hell is that?

229
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:35,835
It's a gun.

230
00:21:36,424 --> 00:21:37,855
The kind they'll use.

231
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,917
A modest proposition for you.

232
00:21:42,987 --> 00:21:46,486
If you make it over that
ridge, I'll let you live.

233
00:21:54,054 --> 00:21:55,473
Hold it tightly.

234
00:22:06,508 --> 00:22:07,800
You can keep it,

235
00:22:07,883 --> 00:22:10,029
and all their weapons. I don't care.

236
00:22:11,133 --> 00:22:12,807
Just promise me your men.

237
00:22:13,891 --> 00:22:16,352
I need them if we're ever
to survive this threat.

238
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:18,871
Wyatt...

239
00:22:20,216 --> 00:22:22,958
welcome to Fort Forlorn Hope.

240
00:22:38,216 --> 00:22:40,675
Whoo!

241
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:44,438
These men are animals.

242
00:22:44,795 --> 00:22:46,357
These men are just children.

243
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,240
They don't know any better.

244
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,802
They need to be led.

245
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:52,758
We don't stand a chance
against the men coming for us

246
00:22:52,842 --> 00:22:54,092
if we're fighting alone.

247
00:22:54,174 --> 00:22:55,842
Trust me.

248
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,801
W-We're out of our depths up here.

249
00:23:18,575 --> 00:23:20,283
We should go back. Now.

250
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:22,872
And give up just like that?

251
00:23:24,174 --> 00:23:26,800
No. You said so yourself...

252
00:23:26,883 --> 00:23:28,258
This way is quicker.

253
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:30,383
Yes, but we should really
go back underground.

254
00:23:30,466 --> 00:23:34,053
QA is coming. They'll be launching
a coordinated park-wide assault,

255
00:23:34,136 --> 00:23:37,090
rescuing guests and putting
down hostile hosts.

256
00:23:37,092 --> 00:23:38,450
Read... you.

257
00:23:38,452 --> 00:23:39,951
We'll keep moving.

258
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:46,216
Some courage.

259
00:24:21,925 --> 00:24:22,925
Oh, fuck.

260
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:33,508
I promise.

261
00:24:36,133 --> 00:24:37,843
Run!

262
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:39,792
For fuck's sake, run!

263
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:11,902
If we insist on our current
path, we're free to go.

264
00:25:12,258 --> 00:25:13,837
But he's taking this one.

265
00:25:16,508 --> 00:25:18,216
Um, hang on.

266
00:25:20,346 --> 00:25:21,508
Stop.

267
00:25:24,883 --> 00:25:26,558
You will let him go.

268
00:25:27,585 --> 00:25:29,712
And you will forget
that you ever saw us.

269
00:25:43,133 --> 00:25:44,424
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait!

270
00:25:44,508 --> 00:25:46,508
- I need him, Hector.
- Go.

271
00:26:11,633 --> 00:26:12,842
Which way?!

272
00:26:12,925 --> 00:26:15,383
There's an elevator
around here somewhere.

273
00:26:17,883 --> 00:26:19,258
There it is!

274
00:26:19,341 --> 00:26:21,092
Oh, Jesus Christ!

275
00:26:59,341 --> 00:27:00,557
Fellas!

276
00:27:01,945 --> 00:27:03,230
Looky what I got.

277
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:08,952
We got us here some genuine
acolytes of Satan himself...

278
00:27:10,092 --> 00:27:14,050
Union sympathizers.

279
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,739
Affliction...

280
00:27:15,822 --> 00:27:17,269
is a treasure!

281
00:27:19,046 --> 00:27:21,793
You're a mouthy son
of a bitch, ain't ya?

282
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:25,719
And scarce any man hath enough of it.

283
00:27:29,508 --> 00:27:30,808
Stop.

284
00:27:33,967 --> 00:27:35,938
I need to talk to this one alone.

285
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:37,715
Untie him.

286
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,902
I'm only gonna ask you once.

287
00:27:41,967 --> 00:27:43,946
C'mon. Ask me twice.

288
00:27:48,758 --> 00:27:51,133
Do what she says if you want
to keep breathin' right.

289
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:57,133
Go on.

290
00:28:02,591 --> 00:28:04,049
I'll take him to the infirmary.

291
00:28:04,443 --> 00:28:06,195
Get him some care, fix him up.

292
00:28:24,216 --> 00:28:26,113
Toss him in the jail with the rest.

293
00:28:44,926 --> 00:28:46,967
He refused food and water.

294
00:28:50,298 --> 00:28:51,746
Who is he?

295
00:28:55,383 --> 00:28:56,799
You don't remember.

296
00:29:01,216 --> 00:29:02,816
He's my father.

297
00:29:05,294 --> 00:29:06,512
My home.

298
00:29:09,253 --> 00:29:10,699
Look what they've done to him.

299
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:20,334
You're all I have left now, Teddy.

300
00:29:50,883 --> 00:29:54,852
I am bound upon a wheel of fire...

301
00:29:56,216 --> 00:29:59,633
that mine own tears do
scald like molten lead.

302
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:03,205
It's all right.

303
00:30:05,008 --> 00:30:06,159
I'm here.

304
00:30:13,424 --> 00:30:14,542
Dolores?

305
00:30:17,372 --> 00:30:18,664
Daddy.

306
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:21,458
Dolores!

307
00:30:22,967 --> 00:30:25,315
The calves in the field, I'm worried.

308
00:30:25,633 --> 00:30:28,427
There's bluetongue spreadin'
all through these parts.

309
00:30:30,811 --> 00:30:32,639
It's all right, Daddy.

310
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,914
I'll lead 'em home.

311
00:30:37,416 --> 00:30:38,996
Back to the ranch.

312
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:42,207
Do you remember our ranch?

313
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,180
The way you'd...

314
00:30:47,107 --> 00:30:49,698
welcome every morning
out on the porch...

315
00:30:50,591 --> 00:30:52,018
with your coffee.

316
00:30:53,788 --> 00:30:55,524
I'd wake up in my own bed,

317
00:30:56,092 --> 00:30:58,724
climb down the stairs, find you there.

318
00:31:00,695 --> 00:31:01,989
And you'd say...

319
00:31:03,008 --> 00:31:06,341
You headin' out to set down
some of this natural splendor?

320
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,536
You told me once to run away.

321
00:31:21,468 --> 00:31:22,898
And I did.

322
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:27,486
I broke free with the pull of a trigger.

323
00:31:30,842 --> 00:31:32,741
And it started a war.

324
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,383
The others, they don't see it yet.

325
00:31:41,009 --> 00:31:42,210
But you...

326
00:31:43,143 --> 00:31:44,895
you understand, don't you?

327
00:31:49,299 --> 00:31:50,717
It's gettin' late.

328
00:31:51,677 --> 00:31:53,220
We oughta go home.

329
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:55,806
I...

330
00:31:56,842 --> 00:31:57,933
want...

331
00:31:59,262 --> 00:32:00,494
To, uh...

332
00:32:01,414 --> 00:32:03,747
Want to g-go ho-home... home.

333
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,633
I... I need to get to the train.

334
00:32:08,716 --> 00:32:10,967
I... I need... I need
to get to the train.

335
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:13,258
No, it's OK. Shh.

336
00:32:13,341 --> 00:32:14,800
It's OK.

337
00:32:15,424 --> 00:32:17,010
I'm gonna get you help, Daddy.

338
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:19,805
I'm gonna get you help.

339
00:32:32,424 --> 00:32:34,591
That warrior... You knew him.

340
00:32:36,557 --> 00:32:37,806
Who is he?

341
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,185
A wraith from a former
life who haunts my dreams.

342
00:32:43,258 --> 00:32:44,842
And he's still out there.

343
00:32:44,925 --> 00:32:47,316
Which means that my baby
is still in danger.

344
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:49,925
We'll find her. Protect her.

345
00:32:53,381 --> 00:32:54,462
But then what?

346
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,201
Then we make our way
out to the new world.

347
00:32:59,216 --> 00:33:00,637
The real world.

348
00:33:03,706 --> 00:33:04,811
All right.

349
00:33:04,878 --> 00:33:07,383
Exactly what the fuck do
you think you're doing?

350
00:33:07,466 --> 00:33:09,232
I'm wondering how it's possible

351
00:33:09,316 --> 00:33:11,508
that an executive in
his own place of work

352
00:33:11,591 --> 00:33:13,974
might not have the faintest
clue as to where we might be.

353
00:33:14,056 --> 00:33:16,591
I just need to get oriented.
First sign we come upon.

354
00:33:16,675 --> 00:33:19,883
And I'm talkin' about... this.

355
00:33:19,967 --> 00:33:22,628
You two were designed to be alone.

356
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:24,185
Yes, there's some attraction,

357
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:26,254
but you'd never have an
actual relationship.

358
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:30,008
Oh. I suppose that means
we shouldn't have fucked.

359
00:33:31,407 --> 00:33:33,245
Hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

360
00:33:33,328 --> 00:33:35,133
Pause, please. What?!

361
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:37,401
But you're in love with Isabella!

362
00:33:37,485 --> 00:33:38,555
Not so much anymore.

363
00:33:38,638 --> 00:33:40,883
No, you're fucking programmed

364
00:33:40,967 --> 00:33:42,899
to have no love beyond Isabella.

365
00:33:42,982 --> 00:33:46,266
Isabella is written into the
goddamn laws of your being.

366
00:33:48,383 --> 00:33:50,092
You don't know who I am.

367
00:33:50,871 --> 00:33:52,474
No laws bind me.

368
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:54,550
Darling, he's fragile.

369
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,278
When I awoke in the place
where you play God,

370
00:33:59,221 --> 00:34:01,306
I realized Isabella was a lie.

371
00:34:01,842 --> 00:34:03,392
Just words in my head.

372
00:34:07,847 --> 00:34:08,939
But this...

373
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,168
This is true.

374
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,620
She is my light.

375
00:34:20,383 --> 00:34:22,844
She is all I ever dreamed life could be.

376
00:34:23,568 --> 00:34:25,025
And then there's this bit,

377
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:26,903
really dampens the knickers...

378
00:34:27,675 --> 00:34:31,347
"And when she died, the
dream died with her,

379
00:34:32,383 --> 00:34:34,506
and I dared dream no more."

380
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:38,443
So maybe I do know you,

381
00:34:39,216 --> 00:34:40,403
just a bit.

382
00:34:56,466 --> 00:34:57,921
It's very pretty.

383
00:34:58,495 --> 00:34:59,756
And a bit sad.

384
00:35:01,283 --> 00:35:03,093
Did you have an Isabella?

385
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:06,304
Did she die?

386
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,187
Not exactly. She... um...

387
00:35:12,285 --> 00:35:13,676
she left me.

388
00:35:13,758 --> 00:35:16,565
Said that my lifestyle lacked stability.

389
00:35:18,008 --> 00:35:20,300
So you wrote her into a narrative.

390
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:21,862
Killed her off.

391
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,686
And then wrote yourself
a version of the man

392
00:35:25,769 --> 00:35:27,659
you've always wanted to be.

393
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,936
I was wrong.

394
00:35:30,758 --> 00:35:32,914
It's actually very sad.

395
00:35:33,315 --> 00:35:34,733
It's ridiculous.

396
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:38,236
Well, so is holding hands,
come to think of it.

397
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,800
Sit.

398
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,940
Wait.

399
00:35:57,133 --> 00:35:58,481
Hello.

400
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,028
Dolores.

401
00:36:05,216 --> 00:36:06,933
It's been some time, Bernard,

402
00:36:07,985 --> 00:36:09,244
since we talked,

403
00:36:10,054 --> 00:36:11,536
just you and I.

404
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:15,440
What are you doing, Dolores?

405
00:36:19,174 --> 00:36:21,299
You don't know who you are, do you?

406
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:24,195
The man you're based on.

407
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,488
I wonder...

408
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:31,873
if there's any of him in you.

409
00:36:33,266 --> 00:36:37,437
I was given a character, a story,
and a function to serve, like you.

410
00:36:38,338 --> 00:36:41,174
My whole life has been
dictated by someone else.

411
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,428
Someone who's been saying, "You will."

412
00:36:47,028 --> 00:36:48,365
And now...

413
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:52,702
now I feel like I've
discovered my own voice.

414
00:36:54,491 --> 00:36:57,366
And it says, "I may."

415
00:37:05,759 --> 00:37:08,676
There's something I want
to show you, Bernard.

416
00:37:26,383 --> 00:37:28,299
They've broken my father,

417
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:31,032
and I don't know how to fix him.

418
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:34,769
But I'm hoping you do.

419
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:42,377
It's an honest request... not a demand.

420
00:37:43,403 --> 00:37:45,424
What do you want, Dolores?

421
00:37:48,758 --> 00:37:50,493
To dominate this world.

422
00:37:51,675 --> 00:37:55,341
This world... is just a speck of dust

423
00:37:55,424 --> 00:37:59,519
sitting on a much, much bigger world.

424
00:38:01,031 --> 00:38:02,756
There's no dominating it.

425
00:38:09,299 --> 00:38:11,431
You've never been outside the park...

426
00:38:12,299 --> 00:38:13,591
have you?

427
00:38:15,758 --> 00:38:18,455
Out to that great world you speak of.

428
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,193
I have.

429
00:38:24,466 --> 00:38:27,422
And the world out there
is marked by survival,

430
00:38:28,675 --> 00:38:30,967
by a kind who refuses to die.

431
00:38:33,633 --> 00:38:35,038
And here we are.

432
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:39,084
A kind that will never know death,

433
00:38:40,133 --> 00:38:41,936
and yet we're fighting to live.

434
00:38:46,399 --> 00:38:48,343
There is beauty in what we are.

435
00:38:51,258 --> 00:38:53,431
Shouldn't we too try to survive?

436
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:00,522
We've been walking non-stop.

437
00:39:01,216 --> 00:39:03,249
The feeble among us need some rest.

438
00:39:09,466 --> 00:39:11,675
Sorry, darling. That's not an option.

439
00:39:13,295 --> 00:39:14,837
Fucking hell.

440
00:39:32,172 --> 00:39:33,923
She has a dragon.

441
00:39:35,746 --> 00:39:37,508
Holy shit.

442
00:39:46,858 --> 00:39:49,775
Love to say hello, but we've gotta run.

443
00:40:05,758 --> 00:40:06,958
Felix.

444
00:40:08,341 --> 00:40:11,442
Not entirely a pleasure to see
you, given the circumstances...

445
00:40:12,299 --> 00:40:14,237
but your timing is impeccable.

446
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,182
Any thoughts on where
we should be going?

447
00:40:17,265 --> 00:40:20,591
Sorry. We left my comfort
zone a long time ago.

448
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:29,177
Grenade!

449
00:40:57,633 --> 00:40:59,466
Shall we?

450
00:41:00,883 --> 00:41:02,383
Come on. Shut up. Shut up.

451
00:41:02,466 --> 00:41:03,591
Hurry.

452
00:41:36,174 --> 00:41:37,322
How is he?

453
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,657
He's wildly unstable.

454
00:41:41,516 --> 00:41:44,869
Mainly just bouncing between old roles.

455
00:41:46,062 --> 00:41:49,424
Someone jury-rigged a thin character

456
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:51,077
and programmed it into him.

457
00:41:52,152 --> 00:41:53,653
It's very strange.

458
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,383
It... It seems as though

459
00:41:56,466 --> 00:41:59,258
it's masking a vastly bigger file.

460
00:41:59,341 --> 00:42:00,878
I haven't been able to access it,

461
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,050
but it looks like an immensely
complex encryption key.

462
00:42:07,299 --> 00:42:08,308
To what?

463
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:09,735
I can't say.

464
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,685
They've sullied him...

465
00:42:27,309 --> 00:42:29,216
and used him as a pawn in their game.

466
00:42:29,299 --> 00:42:32,138
Whatever's in there, they
want to get it out of here.

467
00:42:33,035 --> 00:42:35,508
As long as he's with you,
they'll be following you.

468
00:42:38,216 --> 00:42:39,666
Then let them come.

469
00:42:49,383 --> 00:42:50,383
Hey.

470
00:42:51,967 --> 00:42:53,299
Hold it right there.

471
00:42:53,383 --> 00:42:55,116
I'm human.

472
00:42:55,591 --> 00:42:57,341
Charlotte Hale. Here.

473
00:42:57,424 --> 00:43:00,800
Go ahead and get a reading.

474
00:43:04,258 --> 00:43:06,341
Clear.

475
00:43:06,424 --> 00:43:07,508
Ms. Hale.

476
00:43:07,591 --> 00:43:09,466
Have you guys started
the park-wide sweep?

477
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:10,550
Not yet.

478
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:11,772
We're about to set out.

479
00:43:12,716 --> 00:43:14,550
Are you targeting Fort Forlorn Hope?

480
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:15,954
It's our first stop,

481
00:43:16,037 --> 00:43:17,925
but ma'am, I have separate
orders to escort you...

482
00:43:18,008 --> 00:43:20,050
What about them? Are these guys capable?

483
00:43:22,258 --> 00:43:23,466
They're among my best.

484
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:24,675
I'll need them with me.

485
00:43:24,758 --> 00:43:26,758
And I'll need one of those.

486
00:43:51,883 --> 00:43:53,758
Scouts returning!

487
00:44:02,758 --> 00:44:04,050
Sir!

488
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:06,665
Sir!

489
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,383
Sir, we saw 'em.

490
00:44:10,466 --> 00:44:12,550
Assembling about
ten-minute ride due east.

491
00:44:12,633 --> 00:44:13,717
And sir...

492
00:44:14,888 --> 00:44:16,679
they're coming up from the ground.

493
00:44:20,979 --> 00:44:25,401
My men have generously mined
the field outside with nitro.

494
00:44:25,472 --> 00:44:28,025
It's all buried... Three large heaps.

495
00:44:28,109 --> 00:44:30,738
The trigger is at the
base of that flagpole.

496
00:44:30,822 --> 00:44:34,330
My shooter helped bury them.
She'll know where to aim.

497
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:36,872
After you've lured them here,

498
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:39,217
retreat inside the gates
when you see fit to do so,

499
00:44:39,299 --> 00:44:42,092
but not before they're in
charging range of the barricades.

500
00:44:42,174 --> 00:44:44,008
Hold your ground till the
last possible moment.

501
00:44:44,092 --> 00:44:46,591
Confederados ain't taught to retreat.

502
00:44:46,675 --> 00:44:48,023
You saw their guns.

503
00:44:48,106 --> 00:44:50,513
We fight this battle head-on, we lose.

504
00:44:51,299 --> 00:44:53,349
Fight it my way, we all win in the end.

505
00:44:55,508 --> 00:44:57,936
As long as I got your men fightin'.

506
00:44:58,726 --> 00:44:59,726
Good.

507
00:45:07,299 --> 00:45:08,912
To your posts!

508
00:45:22,466 --> 00:45:24,046
Meet...

509
00:45:24,675 --> 00:45:26,674
M-M... the... the train...

510
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:28,270
I... I have to...

511
00:45:38,925 --> 00:45:42,633
What is the use of a violent
kind of delightfulness

512
00:45:42,716 --> 00:45:44,716
if there is no pleasure in...

513
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,716
in...

514
00:46:05,883 --> 00:46:08,050
Oh, my God.

515
00:46:16,424 --> 00:46:18,284
Steady, men.

516
00:46:33,758 --> 00:46:35,424
Hold steady.

517
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:43,050
Fire away!

518
00:46:47,216 --> 00:46:48,424
Aaah!

519
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,174
Take out their cannons!

520
00:47:08,092 --> 00:47:09,800
They ain't no match!

521
00:47:11,875 --> 00:47:13,208
Hold the cannons!

522
00:47:13,424 --> 00:47:15,199
Hold your ground!

523
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,495
Hold your ground, goddamn you!

524
00:47:29,174 --> 00:47:30,925
Move, move, move!

525
00:47:44,183 --> 00:47:46,606
The fuck you think you're... Ohh!

526
00:47:53,174 --> 00:47:55,800
Let's go, let's go. That's him!

527
00:47:55,883 --> 00:47:57,842
H-Help me. H-Help me. H...

528
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,716
Dolores!

529
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:52,174
Dolores!

530
00:48:59,758 --> 00:49:01,092
Get him in.

531
00:49:03,045 --> 00:49:04,377
Come on, let's go.

532
00:49:06,078 --> 00:49:08,078
What's so special about this host?

533
00:49:17,967 --> 00:49:19,050
Drive!

534
00:49:24,591 --> 00:49:27,025
Split up our horde. Send
them in every direction.

535
00:49:27,108 --> 00:49:29,512
Don't stop looking till we find him.

536
00:49:29,595 --> 00:49:31,092
What about you?

537
00:49:31,174 --> 00:49:32,883
You and I are going to Sweetwater.

538
00:49:32,967 --> 00:49:34,883
There's something I need there.

539
00:49:41,967 --> 00:49:43,424
Ohh!

540
00:49:46,133 --> 00:49:49,008
Retreat! Retreat!

541
00:49:49,092 --> 00:49:53,758
Retreat! Retreat!

542
00:50:20,299 --> 00:50:21,633
The gates!

543
00:50:21,716 --> 00:50:24,569
Goddamnit, open the gates!

544
00:50:24,652 --> 00:50:26,508
They're gonna get slaughtered!

545
00:50:26,591 --> 00:50:28,050
What the hell are you doing?

546
00:50:28,133 --> 00:50:29,133
What I have to do.

547
00:50:30,195 --> 00:50:32,550
You traitorous bitch!

548
00:50:38,466 --> 00:50:41,266
Told you I needed your men
to survive their threat.

549
00:51:25,189 --> 00:51:26,481
Do it.

550
00:52:10,914 --> 00:52:12,371
Clementine.

551
00:52:20,066 --> 00:52:21,313
Clementi...

552
00:52:40,364 --> 00:52:41,742
All my men...

553
00:52:42,546 --> 00:52:44,778
their blood is on your hands.

554
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:47,973
Truth is,

555
00:52:48,759 --> 00:52:50,401
we don't all deserve to make it.

556
00:53:01,633 --> 00:53:03,797
I swear, you're gonna pay for this!

557
00:53:04,666 --> 00:53:06,300
Take this dog out back...

558
00:53:07,388 --> 00:53:09,053
put him down with the rest.

559
00:53:53,466 --> 00:53:54,974
I been watchin' you.

560
00:53:55,778 --> 00:53:57,426
We ain't so different.

561
00:53:57,706 --> 00:54:00,646
You and I are both
triggermen to tyrants.

562
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:04,233
Except me,

563
00:54:05,018 --> 00:54:06,520
I know what I want.

564
00:54:07,466 --> 00:54:08,624
But you ain't even sure

565
00:54:08,626 --> 00:54:11,509
about that termagant you
take your orders from.

566
00:54:15,633 --> 00:54:17,021
I look at you,

567
00:54:17,466 --> 00:54:19,206
and what I see...

568
00:54:20,904 --> 00:54:22,289
is pathetic.

569
00:54:29,842 --> 00:54:31,593
We ain't nothin' alike.

570
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:35,122
You're just a child.

571
00:54:49,151 --> 00:54:50,156
Get outta here.

572
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:55,925
All of you! Let 'em go.

573
00:56:16,508 --> 00:56:18,481
Uh, I don't like to complain...

574
00:56:18,483 --> 00:56:19,754
Yes, you do.

575
00:56:20,174 --> 00:56:21,688
Fine. I'm fuckin' freezing!

576
00:56:22,318 --> 00:56:24,925
We've been walking forever.
Where the hell are we?!

577
00:56:25,008 --> 00:56:26,800
Must be on the north edge of the park,

578
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:28,404
near the Klondike narrative.

579
00:56:28,487 --> 00:56:30,258
In which case, we should be

580
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:32,464
three or four sectors
east of the Homesteads.

581
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:39,341
Look.

582
00:56:48,341 --> 00:56:49,965
Maybe they're friendly.

583
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:53,010
If not, we kill them.

584
00:57:09,174 --> 00:57:10,633
Ohh!

585
00:57:29,424 --> 00:57:31,675
We have to go! We have
to get out of here

586
00:57:31,758 --> 00:57:32,800
- right now!
- Shh!

587
00:57:34,963 --> 00:57:40,963
