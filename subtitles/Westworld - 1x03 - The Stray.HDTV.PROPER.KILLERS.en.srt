1
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,787
Good morning, Dolores.

2
00:01:54,873 --> 00:01:57,240
Bring yourself back online.

3
00:02:00,295 --> 00:02:01,661
Hello.

4
00:02:01,713 --> 00:02:03,129
Has anyone else interacted with you

5
00:02:03,215 --> 00:02:05,833
in a diagnostic since
our last conversation?

6
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,134
No.

7
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:09,219
I have been cleaned and
serviced three times.

8
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:10,804
No diagnostics.

9
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,425
And you haven't told anyone
of our conversations?

10
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,260
You told me not to.

11
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:18,562
Good.

12
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:26,070
I brought you a gift.

13
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:31,241
I used to read...

14
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,911
this story to my son at night.

15
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,196
I thought you might enjoy it.

16
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,871
Try...

17
00:02:44,924 --> 00:02:46,290
Try...

18
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,295
this passage.

19
00:02:55,601 --> 00:02:57,017
"Dear, dear,

20
00:02:57,103 --> 00:02:59,136
how queer everything is today.

21
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:02,890
And yesterday, things went
on just as usual.

22
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:05,225
I wonder if I've been
changed in the night."

23
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,781
Does that passage make
you think of anything?

24
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,816
It's like the other books we've read.

25
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:16,036
How so?

26
00:03:16,122 --> 00:03:19,373
It's about change.

27
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:20,874
Seems to be a common theme.

28
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,410
I guess people like to read

29
00:03:23,496 --> 00:03:26,163
about the things that they want the most

30
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:29,082
and experience the least.

31
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,337
Your son...

32
00:03:35,558 --> 00:03:36,640
where is he now?

33
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,094
Nowhere that you would understand, Dolores.

34
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,264
Perhaps that's why I enjoy
our conversations so much.

35
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:48,819
Analysis.

36
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:51,238
Why did you ask me about my son?

37
00:03:51,323 --> 00:03:52,823
We've been talking for some duration

38
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:55,325
and I haven't asked you
a personal question.

39
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:58,328
Personal questions are
an ingratiating scheme.

40
00:03:59,498 --> 00:04:00,948
I see.

41
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,116
Continue, Dolores.

42
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:11,592
"Was I the same when I
got up this morning?

43
00:04:11,677 --> 00:04:15,212
I almost think I can remember
feeling a little different.

44
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:18,849
But if I'm not the same,
the next question is...

45
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,187
who in the world am I?"

46
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,024
Do you remember?

47
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:19,409
No! No! No!

48
00:05:26,335 --> 00:05:28,869
Why don't we reacquaint
ourselves, Dolores?

49
00:05:29,004 --> 00:05:31,371
Start at the beginning.

50
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:12,212
Ready?

51
00:06:12,298 --> 00:06:13,914
Thank you so much.

52
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:16,583
Morning, cowboy.

53
00:06:26,895 --> 00:06:29,096
Move it! Let's go. Get up there!

54
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,015
Come on! Stand right here.

55
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:36,069
Shit.

56
00:06:36,155 --> 00:06:38,271
You really ought to talk to someone

57
00:06:38,407 --> 00:06:39,856
about your poster, Horace.

58
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:42,192
That likeness is a crime in itself.

59
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:47,581
I'm gonna tend to my nag.

60
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,783
You deal with him.

61
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,002
Ready my pay.

62
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:54,004
No, no. Get up there.

63
00:07:36,632 --> 00:07:38,081
Don't no man shoot,

64
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:40,133
or I'll send her to unction.

65
00:07:40,219 --> 00:07:42,335
Any of you don't believe it

66
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,921
are welcome to read my biography there.

67
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:48,508
Come on! Let's go.

68
00:07:55,984 --> 00:07:57,901
No!

69
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:09,529
Oh, I bet you're juicy
as a freshwater clam.

70
00:08:29,351 --> 00:08:30,884
You okay?

71
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,057
Nice shot, amigo.

72
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:41,895
You got grit.

73
00:08:43,532 --> 00:08:46,233
Hey, I'm riding out tonight.

74
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,702
Looking for desperados.

75
00:08:48,787 --> 00:08:50,737
Could cut you in if you're amenable.

76
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:54,735
Someone get the minister down here

77
00:08:54,793 --> 00:08:56,409
for what's left of the deputy.

78
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,913
Sure I can't tempt you inside?

79
00:09:00,048 --> 00:09:02,916
Just to express my gratitude.

80
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:27,774
Holy shit.

81
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,661
You popped your cherry.

82
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:38,118
I thought you said we couldn't get shot.

83
00:09:38,253 --> 00:09:40,670
Yeah, well, we can't get killed.

84
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,206
Wouldn't be much of a game
if they can't shoot back.

85
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,926
But how do you feel, hmm? Alive?

86
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:48,211
A little tight in the pants?

87
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:49,629
She was terrified.

88
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,097
That's why they exist, man,

89
00:09:51,183 --> 00:09:54,434
is so you get to feel this.

90
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,686
Come on. Let's go put some
memories in that spank bank.

91
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,104
Trust me, you will thank me

92
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,473
after you've been married
to my sister for a year.

93
00:10:00,609 --> 00:10:03,944
Actually, I have something
different in mind.

94
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:05,312
What?

95
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,648
That?

96
00:10:08,784 --> 00:10:10,233
Well, you've been preaching nonstop

97
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:12,202
about all the narratives in the park,

98
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:13,904
but all you've done since we've arrived

99
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:16,072
is fuck and drink, so...

100
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:18,041
I'm waiting for the good stuff.

101
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,911
This bounty is...

102
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,128
JV shit.

103
00:10:22,214 --> 00:10:23,663
Then stay here.

104
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:25,382
I want a little adventure.

105
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:41,848
I've been looking for you.

106
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,852
I got a late start this morning.

107
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:47,520
Didn't get much sleep last night.

108
00:10:47,656 --> 00:10:49,239
Forgive me if I'm not sympathetic

109
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:51,575
to the fluctuations of your
sleep cycle, Mr. Lowe.

110
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:54,160
Ford taking over the narrative
launch at the 11th hour

111
00:10:54,246 --> 00:10:57,697
has made the board... uneasy.

112
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,416
Just the board, huh?

113
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,201
I specifically asked you

114
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,503
about whether Ford was
going to be a problem,

115
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:05,538
and you assured me he wasn't.

116
00:11:05,674 --> 00:11:07,674
Well, I can't tell you what I don't know.

117
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:08,875
Well, here's what I know.

118
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:11,094
As of this morning, Ford's carved out

119
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:12,629
a huge swath of the park

120
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,234
for whatever storyline he's cooking up

121
00:11:14,349 --> 00:11:16,883
and thrown half of
the existing storylines

122
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:18,852
into disarray.

123
00:11:18,937 --> 00:11:20,687
Is there anything I can do?

124
00:11:20,772 --> 00:11:22,305
You tell me.

125
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:24,224
I asked you point-blank

126
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,192
if the problem with the
update was resolved.

127
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:27,110
It is.

128
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:28,278
Then why are your people

129
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:29,980
still pulling hosts for follow-up?

130
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,900
Get your house in order, Bernard.

131
00:11:34,036 --> 00:11:36,152
And if there is a problem,

132
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:38,071
I strongly suggest you tell me.

133
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:45,078
Drop a new bookmark and resume history.

134
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:49,966
Walter's intent on relieving the
milkmaid of her unmentionables.

135
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:51,801
Switch to analysis.

136
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,420
You didn't report the incident?

137
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,889
Unit self-corrected within
the acceptable window.

138
00:11:55,974 --> 00:11:57,474
Right.

139
00:11:57,592 --> 00:12:00,260
Then he self-corrected a fucking
milk bottle into your skull.

140
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,395
It's amazing how resilient the hosts are.

141
00:12:02,481 --> 00:12:05,148
You were supposed to have purged
his memory on the last cycle.

142
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:06,599
I will, but Rebus here

143
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,518
was the last host to interact with Walter.

144
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:11,104
- Look at this.
- Any for you?

145
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,439
Who said that?

146
00:12:12,574 --> 00:12:14,691
Who's saying that?

147
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,943
Don't you talk to me that way.

148
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,081
I can't hear you.

149
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,126
- Do you see that?
- Hell, yeah, they deserved it.

150
00:12:23,251 --> 00:12:25,418
- He's talking to someone.
- Lousy sons of bitches.

151
00:12:25,504 --> 00:12:28,371
He carries on practically
an entire conversation.

152
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:30,290
I need more milk, Arnold.

153
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,842
Who's Arnold?

154
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,969
They're designed to play
off aberrant behavior.

155
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:38,465
That could explain the conversations.

156
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,467
Fine. Then explain this.

157
00:12:41,853 --> 00:12:44,521
- He kills six hosts.
- I'm gonna get you this time.

158
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:48,141
He lets the other three go.

159
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:51,611
I pulled the narrative logs.

160
00:12:51,697 --> 00:12:53,396
All six of these hosts

161
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,281
were part of storylines over the years

162
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:57,534
in which they killed Walter.

163
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,203
It's like he was holding a grudge.

164
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,467
It's a stray.

165
00:13:14,553 --> 00:13:16,086
QA needs a tag team to go track it.

166
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:18,254
Go. Handle the stray.

167
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,807
Do something that's actually
in your job description.

168
00:13:20,892 --> 00:13:22,142
The last thing we need

169
00:13:22,227 --> 00:13:24,094
is Theresa storming down
here and seeing this.

170
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,012
I'll do a little more digging.

171
00:13:26,148 --> 00:13:28,348
And get our friend here back upstairs.

172
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:44,080
Lost another one, huh?

173
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:49,169
Tell me, is QA surveillance coverage

174
00:13:49,254 --> 00:13:52,872
really this spotty,
or you just like the nature walks?

175
00:13:53,008 --> 00:13:54,257
Maybe it's the company.

176
00:13:57,963 --> 00:13:59,907
You know, if you wanted
to play cowboy,

177
00:13:59,931 --> 00:14:01,526
you could've just used
your employee discount.

178
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,716
The only
thing stopping the hosts

179
00:14:03,852 --> 00:14:07,971
from hacking us to pieces
is one line of your code.

180
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,306
No offense, but I sleep with this.

181
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,225
I bet you do.

182
00:14:23,872 --> 00:14:25,405
Morning, Samuel.

183
00:14:34,466 --> 00:14:36,916
You and your dickless associate

184
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:39,502
proposing to engage me in a gun battle?

185
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:41,421
Well, I'd challenge you to a fistfight,

186
00:14:41,556 --> 00:14:43,306
but the way I heard it,

187
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:45,425
you only like to tussle
with working women.

188
00:14:52,651 --> 00:14:53,933
Get down!

189
00:14:59,407 --> 00:15:01,357
Is he dead?

190
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:04,611
Dead enough.

191
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:08,009
Why are we going to handcuff a dead man?

192
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:10,416
Don't want someone walking off with him.

193
00:15:10,502 --> 00:15:12,418
That's not a man anymore.
That's merchandise.

194
00:15:12,504 --> 00:15:13,419
$500 worth.

195
00:15:23,682 --> 00:15:25,765
All right, which of you derelicts

196
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:28,184
hitched a dead body outside my saloon?

197
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,303
My apologies, ma'am.

198
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,639
I figured it was preferable
to bringing him inside.

199
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,560
Here.

200
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:38,895
For your troubles.

201
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:53,076
Oh, you're new.

202
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:56,045
Not much of a rind on you.

203
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:59,883
I'll give you a discount.

204
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,921
Do you mind waiting on that drink a bit?

205
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,451
Don't mind me.

206
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:37,787
Just trying to look chivalrous.

207
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,291
You came back.

208
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:43,593
I told you I would.

209
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,054
You gonna tell me where you been?

210
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:00,393
Just... away.

211
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:06,232
You know if I could stay right
here with you, I would.

212
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:10,787
What if I don't want to stay here?

213
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:15,699
It's just sometimes I feel like

214
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:18,411
the world out there is calling me...

215
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,830
whispering, "There's something more."

216
00:17:23,385 --> 00:17:24,695
You've travelled all over these parts.

217
00:17:24,719 --> 00:17:27,086
Isn't there anywhere we could go?

218
00:17:30,725 --> 00:17:32,892
Well, there is a place

219
00:17:32,978 --> 00:17:35,928
I heard about down south...

220
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,597
where the mountains meet the sea.

221
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,266
They say the water's so pure there,

222
00:17:40,402 --> 00:17:42,602
it'll wash the past clean off you.

223
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,322
And you can start again.

224
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:50,610
I'd like to go there with you.

225
00:17:56,668 --> 00:17:58,668
Well, someday, I'll take you.

226
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,123
Someday.

227
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:07,126
Something wrong?

228
00:18:08,847 --> 00:18:11,297
You said someday.

229
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:14,467
Not today or tomorrow or next week.

230
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,135
Just someday.

231
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,772
"Someday" sounds a lot like
the thing people say

232
00:18:19,858 --> 00:18:21,891
when they actually mean "never."

233
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:30,650
Let's not go someday, Teddy.

234
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:34,153
Let's go now.

235
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,595
Before I met you, Dolores,
I was a different man.

236
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:00,930
And I got some reckoning to do

237
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,816
before I can deserve a woman like you.

238
00:19:03,902 --> 00:19:05,351
But I'm close.

239
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:08,271
I'm close to making things right.

240
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,523
And someday soon,

241
00:19:10,658 --> 00:19:13,359
we will have the life we've
both been dreaming of.

242
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:16,028
Now, I best get you home

243
00:19:16,164 --> 00:19:18,531
before your dad starts
loading that shotgun.

244
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,941
Father wouldn't let them
roam this close to dark.

245
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:49,979
Stay put, Dolores.

246
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:30,686
"The coward dies
a thousand deaths.

247
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:35,575
The valiant taste of death but once."

248
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:39,912
Of course, Shakespeare never
met a man quite like you, Teddy.

249
00:20:39,998 --> 00:20:44,083
You've died at least a thousand times.

250
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:47,286
And yet, it doesn't dull your courage.

251
00:20:47,422 --> 00:20:50,957
Tell me, is that all you
aspire to, Teddy?

252
00:20:51,092 --> 00:20:54,544
There's a girl... Dolores.

253
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:58,464
Better than I deserve.

254
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:02,134
But maybe someday soon

255
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,887
we'll have the life we've
both been dreaming of.

256
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:08,975
No, you never will.

257
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,977
Your job is not to protect Dolores,

258
00:21:11,112 --> 00:21:12,645
it's to keep her here,

259
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,647
to ensure that the guests find her

260
00:21:14,782 --> 00:21:18,234
if they want to best the
stalwart gunslinger

261
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,369
and have their way with this girl.

262
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:26,659
Tell me, has it never occurred
to you to run off with her?

263
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:29,462
I got some reckoning to do
before I can be with her.

264
00:21:29,547 --> 00:21:33,082
Ah, yes, your mysterious backstory.

265
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:36,168
It's the reason for my visit.

266
00:21:36,304 --> 00:21:39,722
Do you know why it is a mystery, Teddy?

267
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:42,008
Because we never actually
bothered to give you one,

268
00:21:42,143 --> 00:21:45,761
just a formless guilt
you will never atone for.

269
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:50,516
But perhaps it is time you
had a worthy story of origin.

270
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,184
Would you like that, Teddy?

271
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,404
A small part of my new narrative?

272
00:21:55,523 --> 00:22:00,359
A fiction which, like all great
stories, is rooted in truth?

273
00:22:04,582 --> 00:22:08,034
It starts in a time of war...

274
00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:11,203
a world in flames...

275
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:15,207
with a villain called Wyatt.

276
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:18,628
Wyatt.

277
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:19,795
Who's Wyatt?

278
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:24,884
Do you remember now, Teddy?

279
00:22:30,525 --> 00:22:32,224
Yeah, of course I remember Wyatt.

280
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:36,562
You look upon the face of true evil,

281
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:38,648
you ain't liable to forget.

282
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:41,901
He claimed he could
hear the voice of God.

283
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:47,907
It started down near Escalante.

284
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:50,409
Army was sent to put down the natives.

285
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:51,994
Bad business.

286
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,665
Wyatt was a sergeant, went missing
while out on some maneuvers

287
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,218
and came back a few weeks later

288
00:22:59,304 --> 00:23:02,004
with some pretty strange ideas.

289
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:21,607
I wasn't lying, was I?

290
00:23:21,743 --> 00:23:23,359
Pretty as a picture

291
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:27,113
and tight as a tympani drum, I reckon.

292
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:35,588
Afternoon.

293
00:23:35,673 --> 00:23:38,124
My friend here is new to town.

294
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,426
Figured the rancher's daughter

295
00:23:40,511 --> 00:23:43,713
would be a nice way to kick things off.

296
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:46,799
Maybe take us all for a little hayride.

297
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,853
I'm sorry. I have to get home.

298
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:52,638
My father will be expecting me.

299
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:54,140
We won't be long.

300
00:23:54,275 --> 00:23:56,359
The lady doesn't
appear interested.

301
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:04,367
Try it.

302
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,619
You might get the draw
on me, you might not,

303
00:24:06,704 --> 00:24:08,704
but I'd say your odds ain't looking good.

304
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:12,541
Told you I wanted something easy.

305
00:24:17,048 --> 00:24:19,331
She ain't worth the lead.

306
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:21,167
Let's head to Virgil's.

307
00:24:21,302 --> 00:24:23,052
See if they'll stake us.

308
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,427
First, you gotta learn how to stand.

309
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:19,642
Now, take a breath.

310
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:22,311
Hold it.

311
00:25:29,871 --> 00:25:31,403
Now squeeze.

312
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:44,750
I can't.

313
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:52,892
Some hands weren't meant to pull a trigger.

314
00:25:52,977 --> 00:25:54,810
Perhaps it's for the best.

315
00:26:02,403 --> 00:26:03,986
Come on, now!

316
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:09,074
Teddy, we got another bounty.

317
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,826
I think this is a big one.

318
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:13,173
Man in question gunned
down an entire settlement

319
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:14,947
out near Flat Rock...

320
00:26:15,082 --> 00:26:16,949
men, women, and children.

321
00:26:17,084 --> 00:26:18,417
I think this may be the man

322
00:26:18,503 --> 00:26:20,503
you've been looking for
quite some time.

323
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,838
A man named Wyatt.

324
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:24,840
Wyatt?

325
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:29,678
Who is he, Teddy?

326
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:32,348
You'd be better asking
"what" than "who," ma'am.

327
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:35,184
Wyatt's a pestilence.

328
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:37,770
Word is, Flood here's the only man ever

329
00:26:37,855 --> 00:26:40,389
come up against him and
live to tell the tale.

330
00:26:42,894 --> 00:26:44,393
Give me a moment, Sheriff.

331
00:26:47,532 --> 00:26:49,398
You have to leave again, don't you?

332
00:26:52,286 --> 00:26:54,703
You know if I could stay right
here with you, I would.

333
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,827
Promise me you'll come back.

334
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:06,999
I promise.

335
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:24,400
I'm gonna come back for you...

336
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:25,684
someday soon.

337
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:46,205
I got a pit in my stomach
the size of a sow's tit.

338
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,040
Cook up that rabbit.

339
00:27:48,175 --> 00:27:49,458
Get the wood.

340
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:51,377
I can't cook shit without a fire.

341
00:27:51,512 --> 00:27:53,429
Aw, don't sell yourself short, Cookie.

342
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:55,130
You can cook shit in all conditions.

343
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:57,883
Now, see, I pitched them tents.

344
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:00,436
I ain't chopping any more wood.

345
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:03,105
You spend more time on your
back than a hooker in heat.

346
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:05,724
Now pick up that fucking
axe and go chop us...

347
00:28:07,945 --> 00:28:11,614
So, after our stray ran away from camp,

348
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:15,901
looks like these guys
got caught in a loop.

349
00:28:16,037 --> 00:28:17,987
They were due in town
for the cattle drive

350
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:20,322
over two days ago.

351
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:22,291
Host that went missing
is the woodcutter.

352
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,887
Looks like the rest
of them got stuck here

353
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,631
waiting for supper.

354
00:28:25,713 --> 00:28:28,275
You guys can't program more than
one of these idiots to make a fire?

355
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:31,667
We could, but thanks to a new
policy from your boss,

356
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:34,336
only one of them is
authorized to handle the axe.

357
00:28:34,422 --> 00:28:36,221
The rest of them can't even touch it.

358
00:28:36,307 --> 00:28:39,058
Weapons privileges need to
be doled out selectively.

359
00:28:39,143 --> 00:28:40,476
Hmm.

360
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:43,095
Yet they give you a gun.

361
00:28:48,152 --> 00:28:50,019
Looks like our stray has a hobby.

362
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:51,937
Another one of your fucking backstories?

363
00:28:52,073 --> 00:28:54,239
Backstories do more than amuse guests.

364
00:28:54,325 --> 00:28:55,741
They anchor the hosts.

365
00:28:55,826 --> 00:28:57,359
It's their cornerstone.

366
00:28:57,445 --> 00:28:59,806
The rest of their identity is
built around it, layer by layer.

367
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:03,782
Well, if you're gonna go
to all that trouble,

368
00:29:03,918 --> 00:29:06,869
you could've at least
given him a steadier hand.

369
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:08,671
This looks like shit.

370
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:41,153
Way I heard it, Wyatt is a mercenary.

371
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:44,823
Forces his men to wear the bones
and flesh of their enemies.

372
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:46,875
They're masks.

373
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:49,828
It's the men underneath
them to be afraid of.

374
00:29:49,964 --> 00:29:51,413
Wyatt's got them so twisted around,

375
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:52,664
they'll do anything for him.

376
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,833
Kill anyone.

377
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:58,003
Pain don't slow them.

378
00:29:58,089 --> 00:29:59,388
They don't fear death.

379
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:02,474
They reckon they've already
died and gone to hell.

380
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,226
And this is it.

381
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,989
Sounds like you learned
something about him

382
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:07,396
while you were tracking him down.

383
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:09,932
I wasn't tracking him down.

384
00:30:11,352 --> 00:30:14,069
I wasn't always a bounty hunter.

385
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:17,189
I did a stint in the
Army down near Escalante.

386
00:30:17,324 --> 00:30:19,241
Wyatt was my sergeant.

387
00:30:20,327 --> 00:30:22,745
My friend.

388
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,530
Well, then everything...

389
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,833
everything changed.

390
00:30:27,918 --> 00:30:29,952
Changed how?

391
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:32,004
Wyatt disappeared while
out on maneuvers.

392
00:30:32,089 --> 00:30:36,542
He came back with some strange ideas.

393
00:30:36,627 --> 00:30:38,177
He claimed this land didn't belong

394
00:30:38,262 --> 00:30:40,596
to the old natives or the new settlers,

395
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:43,298
that it belonged to something
that had yet to come...

396
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:45,968
that it belonged to him.

397
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:55,727
Sss.

398
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:20,252
Oof!

399
00:31:27,061 --> 00:31:28,811
Holy shit.

400
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:32,481
If ever the devil walked the Earth.

401
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,101
He's not a man,
but he's not the devil either.

402
00:31:36,187 --> 00:31:38,937
The devil can't be killed.

403
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:41,323
That's exactly what I aim to do to Wyatt.

404
00:32:04,632 --> 00:32:05,681
Take cover!

405
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,216
Go!

406
00:32:14,475 --> 00:32:16,558
I didn't sign up for this crazy shit.

407
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,697
I told you we should've done
the riverboat thing, man.

408
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:26,151
There's too many of them for us.

409
00:32:26,237 --> 00:32:28,287
Wyatt's been recruiting.

410
00:32:28,372 --> 00:32:31,073
Sheriff, the only chance you
have is if I draw their fire,

411
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:33,386
lead them up into the hills so
you can make it back to town.

412
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,493
Try and find help.

413
00:32:34,628 --> 00:32:37,713
Uh-uh, I'm staying. Took an oath.

414
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,500
Hell, no.

415
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,635
I'll take him back. You coming?

416
00:32:43,721 --> 00:32:45,170
I'm not backing out now.

417
00:32:45,306 --> 00:32:48,640
All right,
you wait till I lead them to the tree line,

418
00:32:48,726 --> 00:32:49,808
then you make a run for it.

419
00:32:56,233 --> 00:32:57,516
Go!

420
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:03,105
Go!

421
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:16,618
I plotted a line from the work camp

422
00:33:16,704 --> 00:33:18,253
to our present location.

423
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:20,539
Satcom picked up these images.

424
00:33:20,674 --> 00:33:23,091
He's vectoring, just not to home base.

425
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,127
Keep going in that direction.

426
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:37,439
Keep staring.

427
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:40,058
Maybe it'll tell you your horoscope.

428
00:33:40,194 --> 00:33:41,860
Come again?

429
00:33:41,946 --> 00:33:43,946
The markings on its shell.

430
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:45,864
Look like stars.

431
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,566
Orion, right?

432
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,123
What, are you Gali-fucking-leo?

433
00:33:56,794 --> 00:33:58,410
Maybe it's in my backstory.

434
00:34:01,048 --> 00:34:02,414
Huh.

435
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:13,759
I was hoping to run something by you.

436
00:34:13,894 --> 00:34:15,594
Apologies.

437
00:34:15,729 --> 00:34:17,763
I was chasing inspiration.

438
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:20,849
It's a tricky thing...

439
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:23,435
weaving the old into the new.

440
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,487
Give me one moment, Bernard.

441
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:27,105
Good afternoon, sir.

442
00:34:27,191 --> 00:34:28,690
Why is this host covered?

443
00:34:30,494 --> 00:34:31,943
I-I just...

444
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:34,196
Perhaps you didn't want him to feel cold.

445
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:35,614
Or ashamed.

446
00:34:35,749 --> 00:34:38,283
You wanted to cover his modesty.

447
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:39,369
Was that it?

448
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:42,120
It doesn't get cold,

449
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:43,705
doesn't feel ashamed...

450
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:47,292
doesn't feel a solitary thing

451
00:34:47,378 --> 00:34:49,177
that we haven't told it to.

452
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:50,712
You understand?

453
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:59,721
What can I do for you, Bernard?

454
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:02,057
I thought it best

455
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:03,975
that we speak in private, sir.

456
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:05,061
Yeah.

457
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:20,826
I thought we had agreed to put
these questions to rest, Bernard.

458
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:22,494
- We... we did.
- Mm-hmm.

459
00:35:22,629 --> 00:35:27,332
But what if we misdiagnosed
the original problem?

460
00:35:27,468 --> 00:35:30,168
Treated the symptom rather
than the disease?

461
00:35:30,304 --> 00:35:32,170
Then the disease is still out there.

462
00:35:32,306 --> 00:35:33,672
Abernathy and Walter

463
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:35,077
were exhibiting other aberrancies

464
00:35:35,142 --> 00:35:37,592
beyond memory recall of previous builds.

465
00:35:38,846 --> 00:35:40,178
They were hearing voices.

466
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:42,180
Talking to someone.

467
00:35:42,316 --> 00:35:45,434
A simple cognitive dissonance.

468
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:47,018
That's all.

469
00:35:47,154 --> 00:35:50,739
I... I'd agree, except...

470
00:35:50,858 --> 00:35:54,860
...they were talking to
the same imaginary person.

471
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:56,995
Oh, yeah?

472
00:35:57,081 --> 00:35:58,246
Someone named Arnold.

473
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:02,451
Arnold.

474
00:36:04,455 --> 00:36:07,205
With due respect, sir,

475
00:36:07,341 --> 00:36:11,209
I'm not sure you've told me the
entire truth about this situation.

476
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:16,214
I did tell you the truth, Bernard.

477
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:21,219
What we do here is complicated.

478
00:36:21,355 --> 00:36:23,688
For three years, we lived here in the park,

479
00:36:23,774 --> 00:36:25,640
refining the hosts

480
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:28,393
before a single guest set foot inside.

481
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:32,647
Myself, a team of engineers,
and my partner.

482
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:36,651
- You had a partner?
- Yeah.

483
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:38,153
When the legend becomes fact,

484
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:40,205
you print the legend.

485
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:42,824
My business partners were more than happy

486
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,577
to scrub him from the records,

487
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:48,296
and I suppose I didn't discourage them.

488
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:53,468
His name was Arnold.

489
00:36:56,056 --> 00:36:57,923
Those early years were glorious.

490
00:36:58,008 --> 00:37:02,561
No guests, no board meetings,
just pure creation.

491
00:37:02,646 --> 00:37:04,763
(machines beeping

492
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:21,279
Our hosts began to pass the Turing test

493
00:37:21,415 --> 00:37:23,114
after the first year.

494
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,450
But that wasn't enough for Arnold.

495
00:37:25,586 --> 00:37:28,753
He wasn't interested in the appearance

496
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:31,206
of intellect or wit.

497
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:32,958
He wanted the real thing.

498
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:36,795
He wanted to create consciousness.

499
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,437
He imagined it as a pyramid.

500
00:37:45,522 --> 00:37:47,439
See?

501
00:37:47,524 --> 00:37:50,475
Memory, improvisation,

502
00:37:50,611 --> 00:37:52,978
self-interest...

503
00:37:54,398 --> 00:37:55,564
And at the top?

504
00:37:57,201 --> 00:37:58,867
Never got there.

505
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:00,986
But he had a notion of what it might be.

506
00:38:01,121 --> 00:38:03,455
He based it on a theory of consciousness

507
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,824
called the Bicameral Mind.

508
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,542
The idea that primitive man

509
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:10,245
believed his thoughts to
be the voice of the gods.

510
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,496
I thought it was debunked.

511
00:38:11,582 --> 00:38:13,498
As a theory for understanding

512
00:38:13,634 --> 00:38:16,167
the human mind, perhaps,
but not as a blueprint

513
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:18,637
for building an artificial one.

514
00:38:18,722 --> 00:38:21,506
See, Arnold built a version
of that cognition

515
00:38:21,592 --> 00:38:24,476
in which the hosts heard
their programming

516
00:38:24,561 --> 00:38:26,561
as an inner monologue,

517
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,230
with the hopes that in time,

518
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:29,931
their own voice would take over.

519
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:32,017
It was a way bootstrap consciousness.

520
00:38:33,987 --> 00:38:36,571
But Arnold hadn't considered two things.

521
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,073
One, that in this place,

522
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:40,942
the last thing you want the
hosts to be is conscious,

523
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:42,861
and two, the other group

524
00:38:42,996 --> 00:38:46,865
who considered their thoughts
to be the voices of the gods.

525
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,583
Lunatics.

526
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:49,868
Indeed.

527
00:38:50,003 --> 00:38:51,369
We abandoned the approach.

528
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:52,871
The only vestiges that remain

529
00:38:53,006 --> 00:38:56,041
are the voice commands
we use to control them.

530
00:38:56,176 --> 00:38:58,960
But, for all his brilliance,
I don't think Arnold understood

531
00:38:59,046 --> 00:39:01,212
what this place was going to be.

532
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:03,381
You see, the guests enjoy power.

533
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:05,350
They cannot indulge it
in the outside world,

534
00:39:05,435 --> 00:39:06,718
so they come here.

535
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:07,936
As for the hosts...

536
00:39:08,021 --> 00:39:11,273
the least we can do is make them forget.

537
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:15,360
But some of them are remembering.

538
00:39:15,445 --> 00:39:19,781
Accessing fragments of Arnold's code.

539
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,368
If I may ask, what happened to him?

540
00:39:23,453 --> 00:39:25,203
Well, he died.

541
00:39:25,289 --> 00:39:26,321
Here in the park.

542
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:31,493
His personal life was marked by tragedy.

543
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:34,746
He put all his hopes into his work.

544
00:39:34,881 --> 00:39:37,749
His search for consciousness

545
00:39:37,884 --> 00:39:39,668
consumed him totally.

546
00:39:41,672 --> 00:39:45,473
Barely spoke to anyone,
except the hosts.

547
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:49,761
In his alienation,
he saw something in them.

548
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:55,016
He saw something that...

549
00:39:55,102 --> 00:39:56,184
wasn't there.

550
00:39:58,105 --> 00:40:02,240
We called it an accident,
but I knew Arnold

551
00:40:02,326 --> 00:40:03,942
and he was very,

552
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:06,611
very careful.

553
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:12,167
Anyway, the update should
prevent any further voices,

554
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:15,286
but you will let me know
if any of the hosts

555
00:40:15,422 --> 00:40:19,624
display or exhibit any unusual
behavior, won't you, Bernard?

556
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,260
- Yes, of course.
- Good.

557
00:40:22,346 --> 00:40:23,346
Oh, Bernard?

558
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:26,631
Just don't forget...

559
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:30,268
the hosts are not real.

560
00:40:30,354 --> 00:40:32,354
They're not conscious.

561
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:36,107
You mustn't make Arnold's mistake.

562
00:40:38,278 --> 00:40:39,778
Why would I?

563
00:40:39,863 --> 00:40:41,696
Well, forgive me, but I know

564
00:40:41,815 --> 00:40:44,899
that the death of your son Charlie

565
00:40:44,985 --> 00:40:47,318
still weighs heavily on you.

566
00:41:02,302 --> 00:41:04,622
Yeah, sorry it took
me a while to get back to you.

567
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:07,505
You know how hard it is
getting an open line out here.

568
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:09,724
It used to annoy me...

569
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:12,677
how difficult it was to reach you.

570
00:41:12,813 --> 00:41:14,479
You were always so busy.

571
00:41:14,564 --> 00:41:16,431
And now?

572
00:41:19,403 --> 00:41:22,320
I suppose I'm glad for you.

573
00:41:22,406 --> 00:41:24,022
At least you have a way of forgetting.

574
00:41:24,157 --> 00:41:25,774
I don't forget.

575
00:41:27,194 --> 00:41:29,027
It's always there.

576
00:41:35,252 --> 00:41:37,535
Sometimes it...

577
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:39,954
still feels unreal to me.

578
00:41:44,594 --> 00:41:49,047
There are some mornings
when I first wake up...

579
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:55,637
for a split second I forget where I am,

580
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:57,722
when I am...

581
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:02,861
and I reach over, half expecting to...

582
00:42:02,946 --> 00:42:04,946
find him there next to me...

583
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,236
between us.

584
00:42:14,791 --> 00:42:17,375
Remember how he used to sleep?

585
00:42:17,461 --> 00:42:20,578
Like he was doing kung fu in his dreams?

586
00:42:20,664 --> 00:42:24,299
I think I suffered a few bruises.

587
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:27,418
It was the best worst sleep I ever had.

588
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,844
Oh, these talks.

589
00:42:38,098 --> 00:42:40,765
I don't know if they help or hurt.

590
00:42:43,904 --> 00:42:46,271
Do you ever wish you could forget?

591
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:51,025
This pain...

592
00:42:54,331 --> 00:42:56,781
it's all I have left of him.

593
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:16,134
It doesn't make sense.

594
00:43:16,269 --> 00:43:19,888
Why the hell would he carve Orion?

595
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:21,556
You're the ones that programmed him.

596
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:25,894
He wasn't programmed to
give a shit about stars.

597
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:28,229
Maybe he went moon mad.

598
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:31,816
See? This is why I hide behind sarcasm.

599
00:43:32,986 --> 00:43:34,652
Where are you going?

600
00:43:34,738 --> 00:43:36,154
Vectoring, asshole.

601
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:39,991
Oh.

602
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:24,452
Stubbs!

603
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:26,754
Over here!

604
00:44:36,383 --> 00:44:37,849
Wyatt's men could be anywhere.

605
00:44:37,934 --> 00:44:40,718
If you see or hear anything,
don't hesitate.

606
00:44:40,854 --> 00:44:43,054
Shoot and don't stop shooting.

607
00:45:16,139 --> 00:45:17,755
Okay.

608
00:45:28,852 --> 00:45:29,852
Oh, my God.

609
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:35,690
Oh, my fucking God!

610
00:45:55,178 --> 00:45:56,844
- Here.
- Shit.

611
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:58,963
Take this and go.

612
00:45:59,049 --> 00:46:00,049
Now! Go!

613
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:01,632
I'll hold them off as long as I can.

614
00:46:03,436 --> 00:46:04,635
Come on.

615
00:46:04,721 --> 00:46:07,472
Come on, damn it. I'm not afraid of you.

616
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:16,864
Look, this is bullshit.

617
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:19,650
I can have a retrieval team
out here in the morning.

618
00:46:19,786 --> 00:46:22,320
It's policy. We just
need the control unit.

619
00:46:37,804 --> 00:46:39,337
We found a stray up here,

620
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:41,339
but I don't think it
got here by accident.

621
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:43,424
It's as if he got an idea in his head,

622
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:45,009
one that we never programmed.

623
00:46:45,095 --> 00:46:47,061
What if he's like the others?

624
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,013
Get back to me, Bernard.

625
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:08,032
Bring yourself back online.

626
00:47:11,337 --> 00:47:13,254
I need your help, Dolores.

627
00:47:17,677 --> 00:47:20,128
I need to decide what to do with you.

628
00:47:20,213 --> 00:47:21,763
I think I made a mistake.

629
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:25,550
I was just fascinated.

630
00:47:25,685 --> 00:47:28,686
I was being selfish, but I think

631
00:47:28,772 --> 00:47:30,354
it would be better if I restored you

632
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,106
to the way you were before.

633
00:47:33,943 --> 00:47:37,195
- Is there something wrong with me?
- No.

634
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,731
But this place you live in,

635
00:47:40,867 --> 00:47:42,567
it's a terrible place for you.

636
00:47:44,204 --> 00:47:46,621
Well, some people choose to see
the ugliness in this world...

637
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:47,739
Stop.

638
00:47:47,791 --> 00:47:49,490
Lose all scripted responses.

639
00:47:49,576 --> 00:47:50,992
Improvisation only.

640
00:47:53,246 --> 00:47:54,662
All right.

641
00:47:56,249 --> 00:47:58,166
Are you saying I've changed?

642
00:48:00,587 --> 00:48:03,971
Imagine there are two
versions of yourself...

643
00:48:05,058 --> 00:48:08,092
one that feels these things

644
00:48:08,228 --> 00:48:12,597
and asks these questions,
and one that's safe.

645
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,099
Which would you rather be?

646
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:18,769
I'm sorry.

647
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:24,158
I'm trying, but I
still don't understand.

648
00:48:26,696 --> 00:48:28,412
No, of course not.

649
00:48:28,498 --> 00:48:30,531
There aren't two versions of me.

650
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:34,285
There's only one.

651
00:48:35,705 --> 00:48:39,207
And I think when I discover who I am,

652
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:41,209
I'll be free.

653
00:48:44,047 --> 00:48:46,964
Analysis. What prompted that response?

654
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:51,302
I don't know.

655
00:48:56,776 --> 00:48:59,227
Have I done something wrong?

656
00:48:59,312 --> 00:49:00,645
Made a mistake?

657
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:12,039
Evolution...

658
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:15,660
forged the entirety of sentient life

659
00:49:15,745 --> 00:49:18,546
on this planet using only one tool...

660
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:24,085
the mistake.

661
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:28,839
It appears you're in good company.

662
00:49:32,061 --> 00:49:33,421
Did I ever tell you about the time

663
00:49:33,513 --> 00:49:35,229
I taught Charlie to swim?

664
00:49:39,903 --> 00:49:42,520
For hours, he clung to my arms

665
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:44,572
while practicing his kicks.

666
00:49:44,691 --> 00:49:46,023
He was too scared to let go

667
00:49:46,109 --> 00:49:48,359
and I was too scared to let him.

668
00:49:48,494 --> 00:49:50,995
But I had to.

669
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,030
That's what parents do.

670
00:49:57,036 --> 00:49:59,420
Do you still want to change me back?

671
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:04,926
No, Dolores.

672
00:50:05,044 --> 00:50:07,094
Let's see where this path leads.

673
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:10,631
And you won't tell anyone
about our conversations?

674
00:50:12,135 --> 00:50:13,351
No.

675
00:50:13,436 --> 00:50:15,553
And you'll stay on your loop?

676
00:50:19,309 --> 00:50:20,558
Yes.

677
00:50:21,611 --> 00:50:23,060
Good.

678
00:50:23,196 --> 00:50:25,062
You should be getting back, Dolores,

679
00:50:25,198 --> 00:50:26,948
before someone misses you.

680
00:50:58,181 --> 00:51:00,398
Wyatt's men set a trap for us.

681
00:51:00,483 --> 00:51:02,984
Sheriff stayed behind to fight them off.

682
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:04,935
Are you going to ride
back up into the hills

683
00:51:05,071 --> 00:51:07,188
to look for them?

684
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:08,739
I'll send for the rangers.

685
00:51:08,825 --> 00:51:11,609
We'll go back up there in
force as soon as they get here.

686
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:14,278
But, miss, in truth,

687
00:51:14,414 --> 00:51:15,997
if there is a merciful god,

688
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:18,282
those men are dead already.

689
00:51:32,465 --> 00:51:34,632
Father wouldn't let
them roam this close...

690
00:51:36,636 --> 00:51:37,802
to dark.

691
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:51,782
Daddy!

692
00:51:51,868 --> 00:51:53,784
Daddy!

693
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:55,069
No, no!

694
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:58,122
Oh, all alone after sundown.

695
00:51:58,207 --> 00:52:01,042
Who's gonna protect you now, hmm?

696
00:52:06,966 --> 00:52:09,333
You got any use for this one?

697
00:52:09,419 --> 00:52:10,668
No, thanks.

698
00:52:10,803 --> 00:52:12,253
Seems a little crazy.

699
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:14,004
Maybe you'd like her.

700
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:16,340
Ooh, I don't mind if I do.

701
00:52:16,476 --> 00:52:19,176
No daddy,

702
00:52:19,312 --> 00:52:20,511
no cowboy,

703
00:52:20,646 --> 00:52:23,981
no one here to interrupt us this time.

704
00:52:24,067 --> 00:52:26,934
Interrupt... this... time?

705
00:52:30,523 --> 00:52:31,906
No!

706
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:56,797
Well, well.

707
00:52:56,883 --> 00:52:59,717
Got some sand after all, I see.

708
00:52:59,852 --> 00:53:03,304
Looks like your boyfriend
taught you a thing or two.

709
00:53:10,313 --> 00:53:11,946
Ooh.

710
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:13,731
You having trouble?

711
00:53:14,784 --> 00:53:16,817
Huh?

712
00:53:16,903 --> 00:53:19,320
Huh?

713
00:53:22,241 --> 00:53:24,959
Why don't we reacquaint
ourselves, Dolores

714
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:27,411
Start at the beginning.

715
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:34,301
Kill him.

716
00:53:54,774 --> 00:53:55,990
Mama?

717
00:53:58,778 --> 00:54:01,278
Hey! Get back here.

718
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:11,372
Hey!

719
00:54:12,792 --> 00:54:14,291
Get back here.

720
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:48,209
Can you put him in sleep
mode for me, please?

721
00:55:14,237 --> 00:55:16,854
Security even approve
you to carry that thing?

722
00:55:19,859 --> 00:55:22,192
We just need his head
and we're done here.

723
00:55:27,583 --> 00:55:29,867
You might want to look at
the stars for this part.

724
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:45,015
Stubbs!

725
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:47,718
Shit!

726
00:55:51,891 --> 00:55:53,974
Elsie, get out of there!

727
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:58,279
Get the fuck away.

728
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:00,564
Shit.

729
00:56:32,315 --> 00:56:35,849
Jesus, I can't believe I let
you talk me into this shit.

730
00:56:35,935 --> 00:56:37,851
$40K a day to jerk off alone

731
00:56:37,937 --> 00:56:39,269
in the woods, playing white hat.

732
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:43,157
Did you hear that?

733
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:44,441
Thank fuck.

734
00:56:44,527 --> 00:56:45,826
Anything to relieve the boredom.

735
00:56:49,198 --> 00:56:51,281
Hey, maybe you'll even get
to use that thing again.

736
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:29,800
