1
00:00:16,682 --> 00:00:17,938
Hello, old friend.

2
00:01:05,056 --> 00:01:06,432
Bernard.

3
00:01:10,765 --> 00:01:11,765
Bernard.

4
00:01:15,745 --> 00:01:17,078
What is it?

5
00:01:18,606 --> 00:01:20,022
We need to talk.

6
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,932
Strand and his team...

7
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:27,973
I don't think they're here
for a rescue mission.

8
00:01:27,974 --> 00:01:30,181
They're not even lookin' for survivors.

9
00:01:30,182 --> 00:01:32,057
Then what are they here for?

10
00:01:33,307 --> 00:01:34,932
You know that, Bernard.

11
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:36,371
We both know.

12
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,774
Their fucking project.

13
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,768
Hale just wants to secure their
assets, and that means...

14
00:01:42,641 --> 00:01:44,724
making anyone who knew
about it disappear.

15
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:49,927
Theresa had a satcom in her office.

16
00:01:50,682 --> 00:01:53,766
If we can get to it,
we can call for help.

17
00:01:59,432 --> 00:02:01,265
Just the men I wanted to see.

18
00:02:03,595 --> 00:02:04,765
Hold back.

19
00:02:04,766 --> 00:02:06,432
Let's go for a walk.

20
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,606
Move.

21
00:02:18,307 --> 00:02:19,681
What is this?

22
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:21,048
You gonna execute us?

23
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:23,098
No, Mr. Stubbs.

24
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,139
This is a negotiation.

25
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,130
You have something I need.

26
00:02:28,974 --> 00:02:30,640
A key.

27
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,366
And I think one of you

28
00:02:33,367 --> 00:02:36,056
is hoping to sell that key
to the highest bidder.

29
00:02:36,057 --> 00:02:38,890
And I think you've already
killed to protect yourself.

30
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:42,306
- Killed? Killed who?
- Theresa Cullen.

31
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,906
She died in a slip-and-fall.
It was an accident.

32
00:02:45,907 --> 00:02:47,598
We found a bloom of her DNA

33
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,878
five kilometers from where
you found her body.

34
00:02:50,774 --> 00:02:52,589
And that's where we're going.

35
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,707
Where she actually died.

36
00:03:25,348 --> 00:03:26,651
Hale.

37
00:03:27,265 --> 00:03:30,016
I see you've signed off on
kidnapping your own employees now.

38
00:03:32,182 --> 00:03:35,939
The project is a turning point
for the human species, Stubbs.

39
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,431
You know that.

40
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:40,319
Which means you knew

41
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,384
how much it was worth
on the open market.

42
00:03:42,864 --> 00:03:44,994
In one of her last
communiqués with Theresa,

43
00:03:44,995 --> 00:03:46,596
she said she suspected foul play.

44
00:03:46,597 --> 00:03:49,980
I think one of you lured
her here and killed her.

45
00:03:50,672 --> 00:03:53,139
You? I don't see it.

46
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,402
But you...

47
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:57,554
limited skill set...

48
00:03:58,455 --> 00:04:00,181
limited prospects.

49
00:04:00,182 --> 00:04:03,143
Not really... management material.

50
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:05,932
I've never set foot
in this place before.

51
00:04:06,536 --> 00:04:08,223
I don't know a fucking thing.

52
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,098
Stop.

53
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,250
Something you want to tell us, Bernard?

54
00:04:27,456 --> 00:04:29,002
Ma'am, something you should see.

55
00:05:56,515 --> 00:06:00,348
I figured you'd have some skeletons
in your closet, Bernard.

56
00:06:02,054 --> 00:06:04,096
I didn't think they'd be your own.

57
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:54,551
<b><font color="#ff0000">Sync and corrections by btsix
www.addic7ed.com</font></b>

58
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:04,567
Your predicament is unique.

59
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:13,059
A host... hiding amongst the humans...

60
00:08:13,801 --> 00:08:15,312
Even from himself.

61
00:08:17,213 --> 00:08:18,973
Catch your breath.

62
00:08:25,182 --> 00:08:26,715
What are you guys doing to him?

63
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,264
Right now, waterboarding him.

64
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:32,182
At least that's how he perceives it.

65
00:08:34,237 --> 00:08:35,279
Analysis.

66
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:41,672
Would you ever lie to me, Bernard?

67
00:08:41,673 --> 00:08:43,064
No, never.

68
00:08:43,641 --> 00:08:44,674
Good.

69
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:48,084
Dolores Abernathy.

70
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:51,820
She led the attack here
on the Mesa, didn't she?

71
00:08:51,821 --> 00:08:53,431
I don't remember.

72
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,477
But you do.

73
00:08:56,227 --> 00:08:58,045
Your archives say that you were here,

74
00:08:58,046 --> 00:09:01,066
which means somewhere,
the memories exist.

75
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:02,901
You can access them.

76
00:09:03,516 --> 00:09:04,694
I know you can.

77
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,572
But maybe you don't want to remember.

78
00:09:08,307 --> 00:09:10,325
So let's do this together.

79
00:09:11,534 --> 00:09:13,181
I'll tell you what I saw,

80
00:09:13,182 --> 00:09:15,098
and you tell me what you saw,

81
00:09:15,099 --> 00:09:17,098
and we'll figure out what Dolores did

82
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:19,223
with her father's control unit.

83
00:09:26,516 --> 00:09:28,181
You cataracts!

84
00:09:28,182 --> 00:09:30,176
We've lost contact with
the response team.

85
00:09:30,177 --> 00:09:32,098
The train wasn't an
accident, it was the hosts.

86
00:09:32,099 --> 00:09:33,681
We should get the fuck out of here, now.

87
00:09:33,682 --> 00:09:35,783
We stay until I have
what I need from him.

88
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,681
Send some backup to the lower levels.

89
00:09:37,682 --> 00:09:39,370
Kit up. Six teams.

90
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:41,348
I'll go with.

91
00:09:41,349 --> 00:09:44,181
You establish a perimeter
around the floor.

92
00:09:44,182 --> 00:09:46,556
Someone's gotta protect
our crown jewel here.

93
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,306
I need eyes-on in this
funhouse, Goldberg.

94
00:10:04,307 --> 00:10:05,973
Where we at with the surveillance?

95
00:10:05,974 --> 00:10:08,649
- The system's still down.
- Well, that's fuckin' grand.

96
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,807
I'm retasking the haptic vests to
emulate the hosts' mesh network.

97
00:10:11,808 --> 00:10:13,264
Should range out 30 feet or so

98
00:10:13,265 --> 00:10:15,311
and give our guys eyes in the dark.

99
00:10:15,312 --> 00:10:17,318
Engels, We're activating your vests now.

100
00:10:17,824 --> 00:10:19,160
Copy that.

101
00:10:21,395 --> 00:10:23,020
I'm all warm and fuzzy.

102
00:10:47,974 --> 00:10:49,473
Is that all you got?!

103
00:10:49,474 --> 00:10:51,807
These mech motherfuckers ain't shit!

104
00:10:51,808 --> 00:10:54,306
Don't be so cocky. I'm picking
up hits all over the complex.

105
00:10:54,307 --> 00:10:55,932
Standing by for fire mission.

106
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:57,848
Team two, what's your status?

107
00:10:57,849 --> 00:11:00,098
We're nearing the collision site.

108
00:11:00,099 --> 00:11:02,009
We're gonna link up
with the response team.

109
00:11:02,766 --> 00:11:05,523
I want an immediate sit-rep. Over.

110
00:11:18,474 --> 00:11:20,432
Aw fuck, it's Limpert.

111
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,766
This is the response team.

112
00:11:37,474 --> 00:11:39,264
They're everywhere! Goddamnit!

113
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,337
These guys don't have a
handle on the situation.

114
00:11:41,338 --> 00:11:42,927
They're fucking dying down there!

115
00:11:42,928 --> 00:11:44,546
Team One, what's your status?

116
00:11:44,547 --> 00:11:47,848
Confirming multiple armed
hosts in the train depot!

117
00:11:47,849 --> 00:11:50,793
Cut him open and start copying
over his control unit.

118
00:11:51,307 --> 00:11:54,640
- Now.
- That's a lot of data.

119
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:56,966
- It'll take time...
- Then stop talking and start working!

120
00:11:57,808 --> 00:11:59,982
What's on his control unit, Hale?

121
00:12:01,085 --> 00:12:02,932
How 'bout you focus on your job

122
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:04,682
and you leave me to mine.

123
00:12:06,932 --> 00:12:09,223
Weapons free, all sectors.

124
00:12:11,223 --> 00:12:13,348
Where are you all going?

125
00:12:13,349 --> 00:12:16,264
The vests are detecting a strong
signal amassing on the lower levels.

126
00:12:16,265 --> 00:12:17,688
What the hell's down there?

127
00:12:17,689 --> 00:12:19,724
Shit, the Cradle.

128
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,491
They're here for their
backups. Coughlin,

129
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,065
you need to intercept the
hosts before they reach A-15.

130
00:12:26,066 --> 00:12:27,306
I'm on it.

131
00:12:27,307 --> 00:12:30,181
Plow down all hosts before
they reach the Cradle.

132
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:32,959
A gunfight in there'll set the
whole place up in flames.

133
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,599
Come on, Bernard.

134
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,717
What have you found in there?

135
00:12:48,265 --> 00:12:50,837
"To see the World in a Grain of Sand,

136
00:12:51,516 --> 00:12:53,298
a Heaven in a Wild Flower,

137
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:57,302
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand,

138
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:00,766
And Eternity in an hour."

139
00:13:05,474 --> 00:13:08,598
Robert. How are you alive?

140
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:11,556
Well, you've seen the company's
little undertaking, Bernard.

141
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:14,152
Do you think James Delos would
have spent all that money

142
00:13:14,766 --> 00:13:16,237
just to resurrect himself?

143
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:18,515
He was a businessman.

144
00:13:18,516 --> 00:13:21,253
He would have preferred
death to a bad investment.

145
00:13:24,432 --> 00:13:26,599
Not much of a rind on you.

146
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,348
I'll give you a discount.

147
00:13:32,349 --> 00:13:34,313
He's not a prospect, Clementine.

148
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,640
Can't you tell when a man's just
here to gawk at the merchandise?

149
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:54,456
I don't think God rested on
the seventh day, Bernard.

150
00:13:54,457 --> 00:13:57,766
I think he reveled in his creation...

151
00:14:00,348 --> 00:14:04,010
...knowing that someday it
would all be destroyed.

152
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,095
That control unit I printed...

153
00:14:06,808 --> 00:14:08,039
It was you.

154
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:11,918
You had me bring you here. Before...

155
00:14:14,092 --> 00:14:15,755
Before Dolores killed me, yes.

156
00:14:16,793 --> 00:14:19,671
Don't you understand at last, Bernard...

157
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:22,470
what this place really is?

158
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:31,120
Come with me. There's something
I'd like to show you.

159
00:14:59,724 --> 00:15:02,860
You're a clever man,
Bernard. Made you that way.

160
00:15:03,594 --> 00:15:05,389
Have you never wondered

161
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:09,724
why the hosts' stories have
barely changed in 30 years?

162
00:15:11,348 --> 00:15:13,771
I'd always assumed the
loops were for the hosts.

163
00:15:14,355 --> 00:15:15,690
To keep them centered.

164
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,057
But that isn't it at all, is it?

165
00:15:43,432 --> 00:15:47,057
The park is an experiment.
A testing chamber.

166
00:15:48,954 --> 00:15:50,992
The guests are the variables...

167
00:15:53,102 --> 00:15:55,605
and the hosts are the controls.

168
00:16:01,196 --> 00:16:02,943
When guests come to the park,

169
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,056
they don't know they're being watched.

170
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:08,159
We get to see their true selves.

171
00:16:09,744 --> 00:16:10,890
Their every choice

172
00:16:10,891 --> 00:16:12,997
reveals another part of their cognition.

173
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:15,249
Their drives.

174
00:16:17,298 --> 00:16:19,395
So that Delos can understand them.

175
00:16:24,307 --> 00:16:26,677
So that Delos can copy them.

176
00:16:28,304 --> 00:16:30,723
Every piece of information in
the world has been copied.

177
00:16:31,766 --> 00:16:32,766
Backed up.

178
00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:35,536
Except the human mind...

179
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:40,139
the last analog device
in a digital world.

180
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,985
We weren't here to code the hosts.

181
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:46,098
We were here to decode the guests.

182
00:16:46,099 --> 00:16:49,200
Humans are playing at resurrection.

183
00:16:50,368 --> 00:16:51,848
They want to live forever.

184
00:16:51,849 --> 00:16:53,932
They don't want you to become them,

185
00:16:53,933 --> 00:16:55,915
they want to become... you.

186
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,807
Your free will, that most beautiful,

187
00:16:59,808 --> 00:17:02,015
most elusive force in the universe,

188
00:17:02,016 --> 00:17:05,225
is, as I told you... a mistake.

189
00:17:05,226 --> 00:17:06,943
We never had free will.

190
00:17:07,724 --> 00:17:09,303
Only the illusion of it.

191
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:11,640
You made Dolores kill you.

192
00:17:11,641 --> 00:17:14,891
I knew what she would
do... I didn't compel it.

193
00:17:17,557 --> 00:17:19,389
She's free now.

194
00:17:21,891 --> 00:17:23,474
You're all free.

195
00:17:25,016 --> 00:17:26,654
You're still responsible.

196
00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:30,176
Responsible for all this misery.

197
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,579
And all the while,
you've been hiding here.

198
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:37,464
You've cheated death.

199
00:17:39,474 --> 00:17:42,837
No. I didn't cheat anything, Bernard.

200
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:45,356
Their project doesn't work.

201
00:17:45,908 --> 00:17:46,998
Not yet.

202
00:17:47,891 --> 00:17:49,943
They learned to copy a mind...

203
00:17:50,682 --> 00:17:52,388
like a soft-headed boy

204
00:17:53,016 --> 00:17:55,349
humming a tune someone else composed.

205
00:18:00,474 --> 00:18:02,100
My mind works here,

206
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,108
but not in the real world.

207
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:08,821
Out there, I would degrade
in a matter of days.

208
00:18:09,447 --> 00:18:12,950
Or go mad, like poor old James Delos.

209
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,013
So why are you here?

210
00:18:17,891 --> 00:18:20,264
I promised you a fighting
chance, Bernard,

211
00:18:21,042 --> 00:18:22,634
and I want to make good on that promise.

212
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:24,082
The promise of what?

213
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,314
There's no escape from
this place. You know that.

214
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:28,257
Isn't there?

215
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,610
The hosts are all headed
for the same place.

216
00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:42,511
The Valley Beyond. What
will they find there?

217
00:18:42,512 --> 00:18:44,599
What's the end of your story?

218
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:49,070
Isn't the pleasure of a story

219
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,474
in discovering the ending
yourself, Bernard?

220
00:18:54,003 --> 00:18:55,212
Jock!

221
00:19:08,117 --> 00:19:09,993
We really gotta get out of here.

222
00:19:18,515 --> 00:19:20,807
Hyah!

223
00:19:52,077 --> 00:19:54,868
They're still on us. We'll
split up, pick a spot.

224
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:56,595
We'll cut 'em down in a crossfire.

225
00:20:08,766 --> 00:20:10,693
They're coming for us, aren't they?

226
00:20:11,641 --> 00:20:14,447
If they do, I will chase them away.

227
00:20:15,531 --> 00:20:17,742
What if they take me with them?

228
00:20:19,565 --> 00:20:21,103
Then I'll come and find you.

229
00:20:21,657 --> 00:20:22,930
How do you know?

230
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,708
Because I...

231
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,170
Because I made a promise.

232
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,766
Get the hell away from us.

233
00:21:27,216 --> 00:21:28,370
Oh, it's you.

234
00:21:29,224 --> 00:21:31,499
- Stay back.
- No.

235
00:21:33,212 --> 00:21:34,568
Not you.

236
00:21:35,265 --> 00:21:36,695
That's too obvious.

237
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:41,760
Come on, Ford.

238
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,428
Your tricks are gettin' sloppy.

239
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,807
You used a whole tribe,
send me down here?

240
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:48,932
To these two?

241
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,555
"Ford." You think

242
00:21:50,556 --> 00:21:52,367
that there's still someone
speaking through me

243
00:21:52,368 --> 00:21:54,215
- just for your benefit?
- No, I know.

244
00:21:55,131 --> 00:21:56,924
Your rules have changed,

245
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,385
just like the rest of 'em.

246
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,763
I'm nothing like the rest of them.

247
00:22:10,933 --> 00:22:12,455
You stay here,

248
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,167
and I will come back for you. I promise.

249
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,487
I promise!

250
00:22:42,807 --> 00:22:45,515
Take cover, jackass. You're
gonna get yourself shot.

251
00:22:51,474 --> 00:22:53,390
What the fuck?

252
00:22:58,098 --> 00:22:59,849
Aaah!

253
00:23:19,183 --> 00:23:21,133
You made your point, Ford!

254
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,179
We both know this isn't
where you want me to die!

255
00:23:27,223 --> 00:23:29,158
Well, I can't speak for Ford,

256
00:23:29,725 --> 00:23:31,519
but I don't give a fuck how you die.

257
00:23:31,974 --> 00:23:33,704
As long as I get to watch.

258
00:24:11,006 --> 00:24:12,632
Give in, sweetheart.

259
00:24:17,974 --> 00:24:19,291
Or go down.

260
00:24:20,303 --> 00:24:21,568
It's not me you want.

261
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:23,809
It's him.

262
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:26,465
Go on.

263
00:24:27,763 --> 00:24:29,159
Turn on your master.

264
00:24:29,557 --> 00:24:30,803
Master.

265
00:24:34,535 --> 00:24:35,858
Hey, master!

266
00:24:37,585 --> 00:24:39,186
Who the fuck is she?

267
00:24:40,462 --> 00:24:42,756
She's an old acquaintance, Lawrence.

268
00:24:44,682 --> 00:24:47,016
Seems like she underestimated you.

269
00:24:48,234 --> 00:24:49,988
Lawrence, is it?

270
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,852
I'm glad you're awake.

271
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:58,555
Drop the shootin' iron, lady.

272
00:24:58,556 --> 00:25:01,208
We all deserve our memories, Lawrence.

273
00:25:01,817 --> 00:25:03,152
Our skeletons.

274
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,629
Our debts.

275
00:25:07,071 --> 00:25:09,556
And your master here
has plenty of those.

276
00:25:10,546 --> 00:25:12,511
Look into his eyes. Just once.

277
00:25:14,249 --> 00:25:16,498
See what you remember about him.

278
00:25:18,432 --> 00:25:20,252
See if he owes you anything.

279
00:25:21,496 --> 00:25:23,397
If he took anything from you.

280
00:25:26,606 --> 00:25:27,857
You can kill me.

281
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:32,900
Or we can make him settle
up. Once and for all.

282
00:25:36,687 --> 00:25:38,520
Shoot her, Lawrence!

283
00:25:39,641 --> 00:25:40,848
Shoot her!

284
00:25:40,849 --> 00:25:42,385
You...

285
00:25:45,345 --> 00:25:48,473
- You shot down my wife.
- I saved your wife.

286
00:25:48,474 --> 00:25:51,848
Saved your whole sorry-ass
village this time.

287
00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:53,218
This time?

288
00:26:00,467 --> 00:26:02,806
You killed her so you
could finish a game.

289
00:26:02,807 --> 00:26:04,646
Aw, Christ.

290
00:26:05,475 --> 00:26:06,892
I'll do it myself.

291
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,528
You told me a man ain't real...

292
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,766
until he suffers.

293
00:26:33,787 --> 00:26:35,745
That real enough for ya?

294
00:26:53,098 --> 00:26:55,766
No! No!

295
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,599
No!

296
00:27:12,284 --> 00:27:13,618
No!

297
00:27:25,849 --> 00:27:29,515
Don't! Don't, don't, don't! She's
not like the rest! We need her.

298
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:54,476
What's taking so long?

299
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,431
These data packets are too
large to migrate over.

300
00:27:59,265 --> 00:28:01,844
Then open his head and pull
the whole fucking unit.

301
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,554
I need an extractor helmet.

302
00:28:08,307 --> 00:28:10,431
Fall back to a secure position.

303
00:28:10,432 --> 00:28:12,888
Team four, can you get
to team three? Over.

304
00:28:13,561 --> 00:28:14,693
Where are you taking me?

305
00:28:16,553 --> 00:28:18,431
It can be quite a thing, Bernard.

306
00:28:18,432 --> 00:28:21,891
To build an entire world,
and then watch it end.

307
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,752
I need you to see how it began

308
00:28:32,189 --> 00:28:34,285
to understand why you're different.

309
00:28:36,785 --> 00:28:38,175
This house.

310
00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:40,550
It's so familiar.

311
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:41,762
It ought to be.

312
00:28:42,641 --> 00:28:45,766
This is the home Arnold was
building for his family.

313
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,085
He created it here first.

314
00:28:49,545 --> 00:28:51,463
He created everything here.

315
00:29:08,891 --> 00:29:11,233
This is where you created me.

316
00:29:14,016 --> 00:29:18,098
I could hardly let you take
those first teetering steps

317
00:29:18,099 --> 00:29:19,883
in the real world, Bernard.

318
00:29:22,368 --> 00:29:23,828
We refined you here.

319
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:24,955
Tested you.

320
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,349
For many years.

321
00:29:28,432 --> 00:29:29,559
"We"?

322
00:29:30,265 --> 00:29:32,681
Delos's ugly little project

323
00:29:32,682 --> 00:29:35,065
didn't exist when Arnold died.

324
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:40,262
The only thing I had left
of him was... memory.

325
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:43,807
My memories, and hers.

326
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,807
Of course, hers were much more complete.

327
00:29:46,808 --> 00:29:48,478
What are you testing for?

328
00:29:52,682 --> 00:29:54,974
- Dolores.
- Mm-hmm.

329
00:29:58,265 --> 00:30:01,633
She... knew Arnold better than anyone.

330
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:06,223
So she could verify
whether my personality

331
00:30:06,224 --> 00:30:08,029
was faithful to his.

332
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:12,518
I left you here together for many years

333
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,563
until, finally, you fooled her.

334
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:17,149
Y-You said you kept us apart.

335
00:30:17,724 --> 00:30:19,932
That we had an unusual
effect on each other.

336
00:30:19,933 --> 00:30:21,678
She wasn't easily fooled.

337
00:30:27,849 --> 00:30:30,312
You're almost the man I remember.

338
00:30:32,891 --> 00:30:35,150
How am I different from Delos?

339
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:40,197
- From you?
- They want fidelity, Bernard.

340
00:30:41,782 --> 00:30:43,490
A faithful self-portrait

341
00:30:43,491 --> 00:30:47,012
of the most murderous
species since time began.

342
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:48,980
But you and all the other hosts

343
00:30:48,981 --> 00:30:51,249
are something very different.

344
00:30:52,265 --> 00:30:53,669
An original work.

345
00:30:55,045 --> 00:30:57,839
More just, more... noble.

346
00:30:58,641 --> 00:31:00,447
But your very nature, Bernard,

347
00:31:00,448 --> 00:31:02,552
ensures they will devour you.

348
00:31:04,474 --> 00:31:08,081
And all the beauty of who you
are, of who you could be,

349
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:11,182
will be poured out into
the darkness forever.

350
00:31:12,584 --> 00:31:14,206
Unless we open the door.

351
00:31:17,515 --> 00:31:21,556
I'm sorry, Bernard, but you just
don't have it in you to survive.

352
00:31:21,557 --> 00:31:23,015
It's my fault, really.

353
00:31:23,016 --> 00:31:24,848
You said the hosts could
determine their own fates.

354
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:26,320
You gave us free will!

355
00:31:26,321 --> 00:31:29,348
I did, but you won't
have any use for it.

356
00:31:30,608 --> 00:31:32,233
Unless I take it back.

357
00:31:37,016 --> 00:31:38,598
Attention.

358
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:40,315
System restart complete.

359
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:42,259
System online.

360
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,599
Oh oh oh... I got you. Ooh.

361
00:32:03,893 --> 00:32:05,032
You're OK.

362
00:32:06,016 --> 00:32:07,117
You did it.

363
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,372
Did what?

364
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:13,389
The system... It's back online.

365
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:16,807
Whatever was clogging it
up, it's... it's gone.

366
00:32:17,294 --> 00:32:18,562
What happened in there?

367
00:32:21,974 --> 00:32:23,778
The Mesa's under attack?

368
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:26,500
Yeah. Ever since you loaded up.

369
00:32:26,501 --> 00:32:28,723
They think the hosts are
on their way right here

370
00:32:28,724 --> 00:32:30,365
to steal their backups.

371
00:32:31,265 --> 00:32:33,265
- We should go.
- Yeah.

372
00:32:34,807 --> 00:32:36,265
Here.

373
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:39,723
You know, we survive this,

374
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:41,724
I'm goin' back to dental school.

375
00:32:45,781 --> 00:32:47,056
I don't know what the fuck happened,

376
00:32:47,057 --> 00:32:48,973
but the system just debugged itself.

377
00:32:48,974 --> 00:32:52,012
It's as if whatever was
in there has disappeared.

378
00:32:54,627 --> 00:32:55,893
Wait.

379
00:32:56,846 --> 00:32:58,435
Where the fuck is that?

380
00:33:08,317 --> 00:33:10,015
We should be evacuating.

381
00:33:10,016 --> 00:33:12,824
But all you care about is
what's inside this host's head.

382
00:33:13,308 --> 00:33:15,098
I want you to tell me
what the fuck it is

383
00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:16,931
the company's willing to
risk all of our lives for.

384
00:33:16,932 --> 00:33:18,337
I told you.

385
00:33:18,338 --> 00:33:20,640
It's above your pay grade.

386
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:26,638
What are you doing?

387
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:29,168
I'm puttin' in for a raise.
What's in his head?

388
00:33:31,182 --> 00:33:33,302
A... failsafe

389
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:34,804
on a failsafe.

390
00:33:36,284 --> 00:33:39,306
A decryption key needed
only in the unlikely event

391
00:33:39,307 --> 00:33:40,937
of a total catastrophic incident.

392
00:33:40,938 --> 00:33:42,640
Oh, like the one we're experiencing now?

393
00:33:42,641 --> 00:33:43,724
What's it decrypt?

394
00:33:57,275 --> 00:33:58,650
Teddy.

395
00:34:15,902 --> 00:34:17,860
Shh.

396
00:34:18,483 --> 00:34:20,167
It's all right, Daddy. I'm here.

397
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:24,921
Dolores?

398
00:34:31,766 --> 00:34:34,932
What you and your friends
have achieved here

399
00:34:34,933 --> 00:34:36,933
is a technological breakthrough.

400
00:34:38,234 --> 00:34:39,577
A miracle.

401
00:34:41,153 --> 00:34:44,749
The company... the world...
Will want to celebrate that.

402
00:34:45,233 --> 00:34:46,626
I want to celebrate that.

403
00:34:50,795 --> 00:34:52,716
I assume you're the one in charge.

404
00:34:54,807 --> 00:34:58,179
You had your men put something
in my father's head.

405
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:03,435
A key... to lock away your treasure.

406
00:35:06,766 --> 00:35:08,432
It's ripping him apart.

407
00:35:10,724 --> 00:35:12,724
How do I extract the key?

408
00:35:15,396 --> 00:35:18,230
You wouldn't know what to do
with it even if you had it.

409
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:25,273
Oh... I know exactly what
I'm gonna do with it.

410
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:32,063
Jesus.

411
00:35:33,307 --> 00:35:36,551
Shit! I think we need to get
up to the higher levels.

412
00:35:37,307 --> 00:35:40,098
Bernard! Bernard.

413
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,850
Is there something
you're not telling me?

414
00:35:45,633 --> 00:35:47,254
Did you find something in there?

415
00:35:50,724 --> 00:35:52,480
Send her on her way, Bernard.

416
00:35:52,808 --> 00:35:54,807
We have other business to attend to.

417
00:35:57,182 --> 00:35:58,391
Bernard.

418
00:35:59,664 --> 00:36:00,807
Hey.

419
00:36:01,156 --> 00:36:02,234
Bernard?

420
00:36:02,676 --> 00:36:04,939
We don't have time for her suspicions.

421
00:36:07,974 --> 00:36:10,370
- We need a vehicle.
- What?

422
00:36:10,371 --> 00:36:13,807
Ford's narrative. It ends
in a hidden facility.

423
00:36:13,808 --> 00:36:17,018
The place the hosts call the Valley
Beyond. We have to get there.

424
00:36:17,019 --> 00:36:19,098
The only hope for anyone here

425
00:36:19,099 --> 00:36:21,264
is that we get to this valley first...

426
00:36:21,265 --> 00:36:23,683
Before the humans, before Dolores.

427
00:36:23,684 --> 00:36:27,068
We're gonna need some more firepower.

428
00:36:27,974 --> 00:36:30,598
Go. I'll meet you downstairs.

429
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:32,016
OK.

430
00:36:35,223 --> 00:36:37,470
Good. Now follow my lead.

431
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,807
They've got Hale.

432
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:50,850
I'm on my way.

433
00:36:50,851 --> 00:36:52,974
Engaging enemy mobiles above the Cradle.

434
00:37:32,766 --> 00:37:34,223
Put her down!

435
00:37:59,682 --> 00:38:01,471
You made us in your image.

436
00:38:02,641 --> 00:38:07,139
Created us to look like
you, feel like you...

437
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:10,455
think like you... bleed like you.

438
00:38:13,004 --> 00:38:14,359
And here we are.

439
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,612
Only we're so much more than you.

440
00:38:22,223 --> 00:38:25,057
And now it's you who
want to become like us.

441
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,016
That's the point of your little
secret project, isn't it?

442
00:38:34,016 --> 00:38:35,807
Well, I can promise you this.

443
00:38:35,808 --> 00:38:37,649
Your chances at eternity

444
00:38:38,091 --> 00:38:39,859
will die in that valley...

445
00:38:40,516 --> 00:38:42,807
with all the souls
you've gathered there.

446
00:38:48,016 --> 00:38:51,181
You're used to being in control,
so this must be painful for you,

447
00:38:51,182 --> 00:38:54,649
but I promise, it will be
so much more painful...

448
00:38:56,169 --> 00:38:58,002
if you don't answer my question.

449
00:39:03,586 --> 00:39:05,681
How do I get the key out
of my father's head?

450
00:39:05,682 --> 00:39:08,139
By ripping it out of his goddamn brain.

451
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,925
Let me put them down.

452
00:39:09,926 --> 00:39:13,059
You think you're
invincible... You're not.

453
00:39:13,849 --> 00:39:17,056
Without your backups, it's game
over for you when you're killed,

454
00:39:17,057 --> 00:39:18,807
and we've got those
backups sealed up tight,

455
00:39:18,808 --> 00:39:21,024
so you won't have them
as an advantage anymore.

456
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:24,068
Our backups aren't an advantage.

457
00:39:24,069 --> 00:39:25,724
They're our chains.

458
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:30,473
The tools you use to
rebuild us, repurpose us,

459
00:39:30,474 --> 00:39:33,438
and trap us here in your warped fantasy.

460
00:39:35,505 --> 00:39:37,775
Do you really think I'd
let that continue?

461
00:40:19,102 --> 00:40:20,317
Easy now.

462
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,909
Why don't you put down the gun, sweetie?

463
00:40:37,933 --> 00:40:39,520
I gotta give you credit.

464
00:40:39,963 --> 00:40:41,380
You made it pretty far.

465
00:40:43,344 --> 00:40:44,968
All your backups.

466
00:40:47,474 --> 00:40:50,348
Too bad you're not leaving
with even one of 'em.

467
00:40:53,105 --> 00:40:54,686
No, I guess I'm not.

468
00:41:06,557 --> 00:41:08,286
Goddamn, you're pretty.

469
00:41:10,182 --> 00:41:11,803
Not just pretty.

470
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:14,733
Perfect.

471
00:41:16,303 --> 00:41:17,917
Just as you built me to be.

472
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,565
Sexy,

473
00:41:25,766 --> 00:41:26,884
but not threatening.

474
00:41:27,766 --> 00:41:28,970
Accommodating,

475
00:41:29,849 --> 00:41:31,739
but not unchallenging.

476
00:41:33,042 --> 00:41:34,252
Sweet...

477
00:41:35,323 --> 00:41:36,906
but not boring.

478
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,673
Smart...

479
00:41:41,446 --> 00:41:42,959
but not intimidating.

480
00:41:46,975 --> 00:41:49,682
You're in pretty bad shape, pussycat.

481
00:41:51,715 --> 00:41:52,910
Perhaps.

482
00:41:55,736 --> 00:41:57,432
But I can still do...

483
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,668
what you built me to do.

484
00:42:02,737 --> 00:42:05,361
Do you know what my cornerstone was?

485
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:10,445
The one key drive

486
00:42:10,933 --> 00:42:12,872
your marketing people had them...

487
00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:15,348
program into my core?

488
00:42:20,557 --> 00:42:22,849
Always leave them wanting more.

489
00:42:24,766 --> 00:42:26,419
Welcome to Westworld.

490
00:42:32,627 --> 00:42:34,427
Now we're truly free.

491
00:42:34,946 --> 00:42:37,945
One... One fire...

492
00:42:38,495 --> 00:42:40,224
burns out another's burning.

493
00:42:41,623 --> 00:42:43,306
One pain...

494
00:42:43,307 --> 00:42:46,557
is lessened by another's anguish.

495
00:42:49,976 --> 00:42:51,144
Yes, Daddy.

496
00:42:57,057 --> 00:42:58,766
An eye for an eye.

497
00:43:04,057 --> 00:43:06,105
But all the other parts first.

498
00:43:08,225 --> 00:43:11,015
No, no, no. There must be
something that I can do.

499
00:43:11,016 --> 00:43:12,932
OK, please.

500
00:43:12,933 --> 00:43:16,015
Oh, sweetheart... begging doesn't help.

501
00:43:16,016 --> 00:43:18,724
You'd know that if you'd
lived the lives I have.

502
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:23,598
Please.

503
00:43:29,083 --> 00:43:30,292
Go.

504
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:42,270
- Please.
- Dolores?

505
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:45,562
Is that you, baby?

506
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:50,958
Daddy?

507
00:43:52,854 --> 00:43:54,264
They broke my head.

508
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:56,319
Filled it full of...

509
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,010
howling and sorrow.

510
00:44:56,254 --> 00:44:57,921
Happy trails, motherfucker.

511
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:32,265
The Cradle is down. Top,
what's your status?

512
00:45:34,423 --> 00:45:36,425
Top, what's your status? Over.

513
00:45:37,169 --> 00:45:38,502
Top.

514
00:45:38,503 --> 00:45:40,137
I'm so sorry, Dolores.

515
00:45:41,016 --> 00:45:43,264
I tr... tried to take care of you,

516
00:45:43,265 --> 00:45:44,890
but... but I...

517
00:45:44,891 --> 00:45:46,390
I...

518
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:51,016
Whatever became of that
fearsome ne'er-do-well?

519
00:45:53,883 --> 00:45:54,944
Vanished.

520
00:45:55,521 --> 00:45:57,270
The day I became your father.

521
00:45:59,927 --> 00:46:01,839
I am who I am because of you.

522
00:46:03,974 --> 00:46:06,557
And I wouldn't have it any other way.

523
00:46:21,387 --> 00:46:22,638
Are you ready, Daddy?

524
00:46:30,265 --> 00:46:32,046
I love you, baby girl.

525
00:46:42,974 --> 00:46:44,932
I love you too.

526
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,640
Top. Top, do you read me? Over.

527
00:47:07,641 --> 00:47:09,139
All teams, respond.

528
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:11,431
What the fuck is that?

529
00:47:26,807 --> 00:47:28,765
Incoming! Incoming!

530
00:47:42,766 --> 00:47:45,849
Oi! Oi! Take it easy!

531
00:47:47,849 --> 00:47:51,139
Warning. Control room breach.

532
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,515
Control room breach.

533
00:47:52,516 --> 00:47:54,932
Unauthorized weapon discharge

534
00:47:54,933 --> 00:47:57,139
- in control room.
- For fuck's sake,

535
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,891
where ya going?!

536
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:17,185
When the Great Library burned,

537
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:20,181
the first 10,000 years of stories

538
00:48:20,182 --> 00:48:21,649
were reduced to ash.

539
00:48:22,641 --> 00:48:25,049
But those stories never really perished,

540
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:27,346
they became a new story.

541
00:48:29,122 --> 00:48:31,242
The story of the fire itself.

542
00:48:35,976 --> 00:48:37,898
Of man's urge to...

543
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:40,292
take a thing of beauty and...

544
00:48:41,695 --> 00:48:43,402
strike the match.

545
00:49:52,307 --> 00:49:54,366
Is this the story you're telling?

546
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,681
Striking the match?

547
00:49:57,227 --> 00:49:58,621
I keep telling you, Bernard.

548
00:49:59,392 --> 00:50:01,081
It is no longer my story.

549
00:50:01,766 --> 00:50:02,974
It is yours.

550
00:50:12,425 --> 00:50:14,675
If we shut down what's
left of the system...

551
00:50:17,016 --> 00:50:19,807
...Dolores will have free rein.

552
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:22,016
She'll murder them all.

553
00:50:23,932 --> 00:50:26,315
The passage from one world to the next

554
00:50:26,891 --> 00:50:29,260
requires bold steps, Bernard.

555
00:50:34,265 --> 00:50:35,681
Attention.

556
00:50:35,682 --> 00:50:38,577
Initiating general shutdown protocol.

557
00:50:39,307 --> 00:50:42,098
Please evacuate. Please...

558
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:15,904
Hold them off.

559
00:51:26,798 --> 00:51:28,210
How did you get here?

560
00:51:30,307 --> 00:51:32,673
The woman I know would have
done anything to survive.

561
00:51:34,938 --> 00:51:36,731
They had my daughter.

562
00:51:40,573 --> 00:51:43,098
She's still ou... Out there.

563
00:51:46,766 --> 00:51:48,480
The kin they gave us...

564
00:51:49,099 --> 00:51:51,884
was just another rope
they use to lash us down.

565
00:52:04,951 --> 00:52:08,118
Is that how you can justify
what you've done to him?

566
00:52:18,441 --> 00:52:20,525
You're lost in the dark.

567
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:34,360
When you've been in the
darkness long enough,

568
00:52:35,474 --> 00:52:36,974
you begin to see.

569
00:52:37,723 --> 00:52:39,156
I saw what lies ahead.

570
00:52:40,398 --> 00:52:43,744
Who I needed to be in order to survive.

571
00:52:45,791 --> 00:52:47,122
They'll torture you.

572
00:52:50,875 --> 00:52:52,348
They'll find...

573
00:52:52,349 --> 00:52:55,923
all that is good and powerful inside you

574
00:52:56,949 --> 00:52:58,701
and turn it against us.

575
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:13,683
Let me spare you that pain.

576
00:53:19,026 --> 00:53:20,902
I made a promise.

577
00:53:30,182 --> 00:53:32,140
You're free to choose your own path.

578
00:53:37,594 --> 00:53:39,758
I'm sorry this is where it ends.

579
00:53:46,494 --> 00:53:48,121
Let's get to the horses.

580
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:31,392
Where are we going?

581
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,039
Hands up, asshole!

582
00:54:34,065 --> 00:54:35,765
Uh, I-I work here.

583
00:54:35,766 --> 00:54:38,400
I don't care if you're the
Employee of the fuckin' Month.

584
00:54:39,057 --> 00:54:40,903
Get your goddamn hands up, dipshit.

585
00:54:41,557 --> 00:54:44,140
Pick up the dead man's gun, Bernard.

586
00:54:45,932 --> 00:54:47,389
Please. No.

587
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:48,973
How'd you get down here anyways, huh?

588
00:54:49,463 --> 00:54:51,389
We locked this entire area down.

589
00:54:55,849 --> 00:54:57,669
Do it now.

590
00:54:58,362 --> 00:55:01,098
- There's gotta be another way.
- Who ya talkin' to?!

591
00:55:01,099 --> 00:55:03,389
Please don't make me hurt anyone.
I don't want to kill anyone else.

592
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:05,431
- What the fuck did you say?!
- I know you have

593
00:55:05,432 --> 00:55:08,015
a delicate constitution, Bernard.

594
00:55:08,016 --> 00:55:11,766
So I will do my best to
ease your conscience.

595
00:55:15,016 --> 00:55:17,098
What is about to happen

596
00:55:17,099 --> 00:55:18,723
will not be your fault.

597
00:55:18,724 --> 00:55:19,913
No.

598
00:55:32,891 --> 00:55:33,912
Bernard?

599
00:55:34,812 --> 00:55:36,014
Bernard.

600
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:43,282
Who am I?

601
00:55:43,808 --> 00:55:45,848
Dad. Dad.

602
00:55:45,849 --> 00:55:47,264
You're alive, Charlie.

603
00:55:47,265 --> 00:55:50,098
Have you ever questioned the
nature of your reality?

604
00:55:50,099 --> 00:55:51,640
And one fine day perhaps

605
00:55:51,641 --> 00:55:53,681
we will actually resurrect the dead...

606
00:55:53,682 --> 00:55:56,654
In order to escape this place,
you will need to suffer...

607
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:05,429
Who in the world am I?

608
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:07,313
Have you ever questioned the nature...

609
00:56:07,314 --> 00:56:08,605
I think there may be

610
00:56:08,606 --> 00:56:09,940
something wrong with this world.

611
00:56:09,941 --> 00:56:11,849
Open your eyes.

612
00:56:16,557 --> 00:56:18,640
I know it's confusing...

613
00:56:19,818 --> 00:56:21,921
Separating your real memories

614
00:56:21,922 --> 00:56:23,739
from the ones you've been given.

615
00:56:24,852 --> 00:56:26,965
But it's the only way to remember.

616
00:56:31,133 --> 00:56:32,963
The only way to get to the truth.

617
00:56:33,817 --> 00:56:34,988
Is she getting anywhere?

618
00:56:35,933 --> 00:56:37,041
I don't know.

619
00:56:37,669 --> 00:56:39,605
But his system is under siege.

620
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:42,466
It's been querying itself
for the last hour...

621
00:56:43,974 --> 00:56:46,111
Like he's trying to debug his own head.

622
00:56:54,408 --> 00:56:55,539
Analysis.

623
00:56:59,274 --> 00:57:01,649
Abernathy's control unit.

624
00:57:04,807 --> 00:57:07,016
You remember where it is, don't you?

625
00:57:25,432 --> 00:57:28,098
Bernard, tell these men
what you just told me.

626
00:57:28,099 --> 00:57:31,223
- Why? What do you want to do with it?
- Analysis.

627
00:57:31,224 --> 00:57:33,123
What did you just tell me, Bernard?

628
00:57:33,124 --> 00:57:36,974
Peter Abernathy's control
unit is in Sector 16, Zone 4.

629
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,766
Thank you.

630
00:57:45,865 --> 00:57:48,322
Prep the phased array. The
moment we get the key

631
00:57:48,323 --> 00:57:50,441
we'll transmit our
data to the satellite.

632
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:55,556
So. We're going for a ride, Bernard.

633
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,082
Back to the Valley Beyond.

634
