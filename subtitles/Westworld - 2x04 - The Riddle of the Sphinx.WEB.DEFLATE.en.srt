1
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,121
Last year, my wife took the wrong pills.

2
00:00:11,657 --> 00:00:13,843
I tried to console my daughter,

3
00:00:13,844 --> 00:00:17,529
she told me that my wife's
death was no accident.

4
00:00:17,531 --> 00:00:19,130
That she killed herself.

5
00:00:22,234 --> 00:00:23,817
Are we logging records

6
00:00:23,818 --> 00:00:27,454
of guest's experiences and their DNA?

7
00:00:27,455 --> 00:00:29,406
We're not having that
conversation, Bernard.

8
00:00:30,943 --> 00:00:32,492
The investment here is in the future.

9
00:00:32,493 --> 00:00:34,327
I'm not interested in the future,

10
00:00:34,328 --> 00:00:36,363
I'm interested in reality.

11
00:00:36,364 --> 00:00:38,865
And I think in twenty
years, this will be

12
00:00:38,866 --> 00:00:40,250
the only reality that matters.

13
00:00:40,251 --> 00:00:42,819
Maybe so, but I'll be long gone by then.

14
00:00:43,522 --> 00:00:46,790
This a retirement party? Looks
more like a coronation.

15
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,375
Our arrangement's been a perfect fit,

16
00:00:48,376 --> 00:00:50,347
you stepping down
doesn't help me at all.

17
00:00:50,349 --> 00:00:51,569
Nor me.

18
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:54,741
I was told I might...
I might not have to.

19
00:00:54,742 --> 00:00:57,150
Things are progressing, but we
all need a little patience.

20
00:00:57,151 --> 00:00:59,048
Yeah, well, some of us

21
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,705
can afford to have more
patience than others.

22
00:01:01,706 --> 00:01:03,924
You don't know, do you?

23
00:01:03,926 --> 00:01:05,842
The real purpose of this place?

24
00:01:06,424 --> 00:01:07,506
But I do.

25
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:08,829
And one fine day,

26
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,997
perhaps we, actually,
resurrect the dead.

27
00:01:10,998 --> 00:01:14,183
Call forth Lazarus from his cave.

28
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:56,087

29
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,710
Hmm.

30
00:05:31,124 --> 00:05:32,666
You have a visitor, Mr. Delos.

31
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:34,084
Shall I send him in?

32
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:37,001
'Bout time.

33
00:05:53,751 --> 00:05:55,084
William, m'boy.

34
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:57,132
Where the hell have you been?

35
00:05:57,133 --> 00:05:59,109
It's good to see you again, Jim.

36
00:06:01,084 --> 00:06:03,250
Thank fuck for that.

37
00:06:03,251 --> 00:06:05,667
Most potent thing these
cretins'll give me

38
00:06:05,668 --> 00:06:07,042
is grapefruit juice.

39
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:22,202
It's a little early for me.

40
00:06:24,265 --> 00:06:26,011
A little fuckin' late, you mean.

41
00:06:26,491 --> 00:06:29,389
Besides, if you aim to cheat the devil,

42
00:06:30,207 --> 00:06:31,764
you owe him an offering.

43
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:38,857
So...

44
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:41,292
when can I get out of here?

45
00:06:41,293 --> 00:06:42,382
Soon.

46
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:45,000
The observation period is almost over,

47
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:47,772
and the last step is a
baseline interview.

48
00:06:48,543 --> 00:06:50,584
It's, uh, it's a conversation

49
00:06:50,585 --> 00:06:53,333
that'll give 'em something
to refer back to.

50
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:56,816
All right. Well, let's get on with it!

51
00:06:57,511 --> 00:06:58,877
This is the interview.

52
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:01,712
The thinking is, it should be conducted

53
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,292
by someone that's familiar to you,

54
00:07:03,293 --> 00:07:04,532
a friendly face.

55
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:06,556
It's about capturing your frame of mind,

56
00:07:06,557 --> 00:07:08,653
your mood, your sense of humor.

57
00:07:08,654 --> 00:07:11,167
I own a biotechnology company,

58
00:07:11,168 --> 00:07:13,917
and I'm dying of a
disease whose research

59
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:16,876
I defunded 15 years ago.

60
00:07:16,877 --> 00:07:20,042
I think my sense of humor
is fuckin' intact.

61
00:07:20,994 --> 00:07:23,218
My patience, on the other hand...

62
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:25,570
Fair enough.

63
00:07:26,407 --> 00:07:28,282
I'm gonna ask you a couple of questions.

64
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:33,244
Do you know where you are?

65
00:07:34,273 --> 00:07:36,731
Carlsbad, California,

66
00:07:36,732 --> 00:07:40,917
in some office park I'm
probably overpaying for,

67
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,303
along with the rest of
this fucking endeavor.

68
00:07:43,304 --> 00:07:45,203
And how long you been here?

69
00:07:45,204 --> 00:07:47,322
Far too fuckin' long already.

70
00:07:47,323 --> 00:07:49,552
I've got a business to run.

71
00:07:50,445 --> 00:07:52,917
What is the purpose of these questions?

72
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:56,361
Like I said, they're just
trying to establish a baseline.

73
00:07:56,362 --> 00:07:57,710
For what?!

74
00:07:58,475 --> 00:08:00,126
Fidelity.

75
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:03,925
So, what's the idea?

76
00:08:05,176 --> 00:08:09,514
That afterwards you and I have
the exact same conversation?

77
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:14,269
It seems a little far-fetched,
doesn't it, William?

78
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:43,705
No whiskey, no tobacco, low on ammo...

79
00:08:43,706 --> 00:08:45,587
Wherever it is you're takin' me,

80
00:08:45,588 --> 00:08:47,292
we best get there soon.

81
00:09:32,741 --> 00:09:35,007
Let me go! No!

82
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,971
What are you doing?!

83
00:09:52,712 --> 00:09:54,803
These tracks are supposed to head north,

84
00:09:55,334 --> 00:09:56,646
not west.

85
00:09:57,747 --> 00:10:00,667
Seems like Ford's game
has multiple contenders.

86
00:10:01,418 --> 00:10:03,837
Plus it detours through Las Mudas.

87
00:10:05,168 --> 00:10:08,208
What, that two-bit town? There
are better places to...

88
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:09,734
Oh, cut the crap, Lawrence.

89
00:10:10,251 --> 00:10:13,053
I know you have family there.

90
00:10:13,054 --> 00:10:16,042
Looks like Ford's arranging a reunion.

91
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:43,793
Clementine.

92
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:46,254
Where are we?

93
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,960
Hello?

94
00:11:15,988 --> 00:11:16,988
Who's there?

95
00:11:37,126 --> 00:11:38,250
Elsie?

96
00:11:38,251 --> 00:11:40,292
Are you fucking kidding me?

97
00:11:40,293 --> 00:11:41,993
Stay the hell away from me.

98
00:12:01,334 --> 00:12:02,668
You're OK...

99
00:12:04,251 --> 00:12:05,390
Don't move.

100
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,208
I'm not gonna hurt you, Else.

101
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:09,923
It's too late for that, asshole.

102
00:12:09,924 --> 00:12:12,000
You choked me out and you left me here

103
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:14,208
with a bunch of fuckin'
protein bars and a bucket.

104
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:15,375
It wasn't me.

105
00:12:15,376 --> 00:12:17,751
It was Ford. He forced me.

106
00:12:17,752 --> 00:12:19,208
Oh, he forced you?

107
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:21,125
You knew too much.

108
00:12:21,126 --> 00:12:22,724
He couldn't risk you stopping him.

109
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:24,584
Stopping him from what?

110
00:12:24,585 --> 00:12:28,459
Ford wrote a g-game,
and we're all in it.

111
00:12:29,107 --> 00:12:31,056
Now all the hosts are free,

112
00:12:31,057 --> 00:12:33,083
with no constraints,

113
00:12:33,084 --> 00:12:34,959
n-n-no safeguards.

114
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,422
What are you talking about?

115
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,333
P-Please. Please.

116
00:12:39,334 --> 00:12:41,292
What the hell is wrong with you?

117
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:44,417
Please. P-P-Please.

118
00:12:44,418 --> 00:12:46,500
Elsie, please.

119
00:12:46,501 --> 00:12:47,751
Please.

120
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:50,376
No. Hey.

121
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:56,919
Elsie, p-p-please.

122
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,921
T-T-Tablet.

123
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:07,876
Cognitive... l-l-lock.

124
00:13:21,254 --> 00:13:22,959
But you...

125
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,537
You rotated out.

126
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,391
Where did you go when you rotated out?

127
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,438
You have a family. You have an ex-wife.

128
00:13:34,918 --> 00:13:36,049
You have...

129
00:13:37,626 --> 00:13:38,760
a backstory.

130
00:13:39,905 --> 00:13:41,542
Shh... Shh...

131
00:13:41,543 --> 00:13:44,542
Shutting... down.

132
00:13:44,543 --> 00:13:47,209
- Shh... Shh...
- OK. OK.

133
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:51,709
I can... I can detask your systems,

134
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,833
put you in safe mode.

135
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,917
And don't worry.

136
00:13:57,918 --> 00:13:59,834
I'm not gonna brick you, asshole.

137
00:13:59,835 --> 00:14:03,171
Not yet. You got too
much shit to answer for.

138
00:14:03,172 --> 00:14:06,144
OK. You're gonna be out

139
00:14:06,771 --> 00:14:08,292
in three...

140
00:14:08,293 --> 00:14:10,183
two...

141
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:12,427
one.

142
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,706
Is this now?

143
00:14:50,873 --> 00:14:53,334
You have extensive cortical damage.

144
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:57,171
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you shot yourself.

145
00:14:59,093 --> 00:15:01,625
I altered your code to ignore
the physical damage for now,

146
00:15:01,626 --> 00:15:05,054
but you're not gonna last
long without cortical fluid.

147
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:14,610
With any luck,

148
00:15:14,611 --> 00:15:17,154
you'll survive till they
call in the cavalry.

149
00:15:22,331 --> 00:15:24,289
Elsie, wait!

150
00:15:25,763 --> 00:15:26,763
Elsie.

151
00:15:28,674 --> 00:15:29,757
Wait.

152
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:33,766
No one's coming for any of us.

153
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:38,500
- Delos doesn't want them to.
- What? Why?

154
00:15:38,501 --> 00:15:40,305
There's something here.

155
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,787
Something they've been
working on a long time.

156
00:15:42,788 --> 00:15:45,667
Delos won't call in the rescue
until they've ensured it's safe.

157
00:15:45,668 --> 00:15:47,834
Elsie, please.

158
00:15:47,835 --> 00:15:49,667
I won't last without cortical fluid.

159
00:15:49,668 --> 00:15:51,617
Even if I wanted to,

160
00:15:52,502 --> 00:15:54,292
we don't have any tools.

161
00:15:54,293 --> 00:15:58,167
We're in Sector 22. I mean, there's
nothing out here for miles.

162
00:16:04,918 --> 00:16:06,048
Bernard?

163
00:16:06,943 --> 00:16:08,593
What the hell are you looking at?

164
00:16:30,626 --> 00:16:33,918
Bernard. What the hell
is wrong with you?

165
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,039
There's a facility here.

166
00:16:40,543 --> 00:16:42,834
- What?
- I think Ford

167
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,793
had Clementine bring
me here for a reason.

168
00:17:01,084 --> 00:17:02,542
I told you, there's...

169
00:17:02,543 --> 00:17:05,125
There's really nothing
around here for miles.

170
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:06,792
It's hidden.

171
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,778
It's part of their project.

172
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:28,001
What the hell is that?

173
00:17:44,668 --> 00:17:46,668
Where does that go, Bernard?

174
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,543
I don't remember.

175
00:18:36,088 --> 00:18:37,297
It's a whole lab.

176
00:18:51,668 --> 00:18:53,584
What the hell happened here?

177
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:00,542
Oh, my God.

178
00:19:00,543 --> 00:19:02,626
This is a control unit printer.

179
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:05,876
What are they doing with this?

180
00:19:40,918 --> 00:19:42,250
Bernard.

181
00:19:43,334 --> 00:19:44,459
What the fuck is that?

182
00:19:47,864 --> 00:19:50,197
Don't threaten it and it won't hurt you.

183
00:20:02,837 --> 00:20:04,751
What the hell were they doing here?

184
00:20:04,752 --> 00:20:07,584
I think they were watching the guests.

185
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:11,710
What would they want with the guests?

186
00:20:13,334 --> 00:20:15,459
Great. Cortical fluid.

187
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,543
OK.

188
00:20:27,084 --> 00:20:29,500
Please.

189
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:31,584
Bernard.

190
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,501
Did you have something
to do with this project?

191
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,959
I don't know.

192
00:20:38,768 --> 00:20:40,417
I don't think so.

193
00:20:40,418 --> 00:20:42,575
Is Ford in control of you now?

194
00:20:44,781 --> 00:20:46,238
Ford's dead.

195
00:20:48,145 --> 00:20:49,444
Fuck me.

196
00:20:51,979 --> 00:20:53,083
OK.

197
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:54,834
OK, stay with me, Bernard.

198
00:20:54,835 --> 00:20:55,896
Stay with me.

199
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:03,708
This is gonna hurt.

200
00:21:21,042 --> 00:21:24,125
This can't be happening because
none of this is real, right?

201
00:21:24,126 --> 00:21:26,494
It's gonna be OK. Someone'll rescue us.

202
00:21:27,793 --> 00:21:31,357
Seems to me like our rescue's
in the same boat we are.

203
00:21:38,334 --> 00:21:40,251
Unhh!

204
00:21:56,126 --> 00:21:57,667
She said "time is coming,"

205
00:21:57,668 --> 00:21:59,792
or something "is coming."

206
00:21:59,793 --> 00:22:02,171
You've spent enough time in the park

207
00:22:02,172 --> 00:22:03,751
to learn the language?

208
00:22:05,876 --> 00:22:08,417
A lot of people tend to
ignore their narratives.

209
00:22:08,877 --> 00:22:10,834
I don't like other people very much.

210
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:14,250
I've been watching 'em since
they ambushed me, and...

211
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:15,330
they keep the humans close,

212
00:22:15,331 --> 00:22:17,208
but they're not killin'
us... just the hosts.

213
00:22:17,209 --> 00:22:20,046
No offense, but I'm not gonna
stick around to test that theory.

214
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,792
Safer to wait for the first responders.

215
00:22:21,793 --> 00:22:24,584
There's a protocol for evacuation.

216
00:22:24,585 --> 00:22:26,208
They'll get you out of here.

217
00:22:26,209 --> 00:22:27,720
Thanks.

218
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,625
But, uh...

219
00:22:29,626 --> 00:22:31,709
I'm not looking to get out of here.

220
00:22:38,334 --> 00:22:40,668
Home, sweet home, Lawrence.

221
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,946
Where the hell is everybody?

222
00:23:14,876 --> 00:23:16,417
Whiskey.

223
00:23:16,418 --> 00:23:18,459
Nothin' fancy.

224
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:24,528
You don't seem too happy
to be home, Lawrence.

225
00:23:25,126 --> 00:23:27,031
I've never been the domestic type.

226
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:31,000
By some fluke of nature I got
myself a wife and a daughter

227
00:23:31,384 --> 00:23:32,751
who think I hung the moon.

228
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,248
Truth is, I'm a son of a bitch.

229
00:23:36,877 --> 00:23:39,189
Kindest thing I ever
did was to keep away.

230
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:47,008
The Gran Reserva. Only for our
most distinguished guest.

231
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:50,387
Hey, hey, hey.

232
00:23:51,168 --> 00:23:53,098
I haven't even shot anybody yet.

233
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,751
What's your problem?

234
00:24:06,918 --> 00:24:10,775
You harbor even the faintest
ambition of using that thing

235
00:24:11,268 --> 00:24:14,876
and I'll turn that pretty
face of yours inside-out.

236
00:24:24,277 --> 00:24:27,007
Someone took a chunk out of you boys.

237
00:24:27,741 --> 00:24:29,243
What happened to the rest of you?

238
00:24:29,785 --> 00:24:31,136
Double-crossed...

239
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:33,846
by some bitch name of Wyatt.

240
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:37,605
- Good for her.
- On your feet.

241
00:24:44,548 --> 00:24:46,542
Go on. In here.

242
00:24:59,126 --> 00:25:00,126
Papa!

243
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:02,751
Ah, mija.

244
00:25:08,668 --> 00:25:12,125
Now, me and my men here

245
00:25:12,126 --> 00:25:14,626
have a long journey ahead of us.

246
00:25:16,501 --> 00:25:17,521
Mm.

247
00:25:17,522 --> 00:25:20,461
We need food, whiskey,

248
00:25:21,128 --> 00:25:22,379
and ammunition.

249
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:25,250
You people have some village elder

250
00:25:25,251 --> 00:25:26,584
who can speak for you?

251
00:25:26,585 --> 00:25:28,260
Make some kind of a deal?

252
00:25:48,253 --> 00:25:51,992
I ain't interested in
makin' fuckin' deals.

253
00:25:53,243 --> 00:25:54,703
You understand?

254
00:25:58,209 --> 00:26:00,417
We know you motherfuckers are rebels.

255
00:26:03,668 --> 00:26:06,125
So you're gonna tell me where the fuck

256
00:26:06,126 --> 00:26:08,816
you hid your weapons,
or you're gonna die.

257
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,277
The second we tell him

258
00:26:11,209 --> 00:26:13,305
he's gonna kill us all anyway.

259
00:26:20,293 --> 00:26:21,668
They got my family.

260
00:26:22,548 --> 00:26:24,047
My daughter.

261
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,378
You told me you had a daughter.

262
00:26:34,042 --> 00:26:35,124
Did I?

263
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:37,971
I don't know. At some point.

264
00:26:39,001 --> 00:26:41,166
You ain't exactly forthcoming...

265
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,379
but I remember that much.

266
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:48,841
The point is,

267
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:54,083
you think she'd want to watch you
gunned down in front of her?

268
00:26:55,802 --> 00:26:56,802
Probably.

269
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,663
Well, I'm not gonna fuckin' die here.

270
00:27:03,406 --> 00:27:05,302
We just need to get the weapons.

271
00:27:08,344 --> 00:27:09,878
You know where they are?

272
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,876
They're in an unmarked grave out back.

273
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:17,025
We'll wait till they're drunk,

274
00:27:17,026 --> 00:27:18,542
make a run for it.

275
00:27:18,543 --> 00:27:20,543
Sound like a plan?

276
00:27:23,918 --> 00:27:25,251
Yeah.

277
00:27:29,626 --> 00:27:31,044
What the fuck are you doin'?

278
00:27:31,045 --> 00:27:32,249
You.

279
00:27:34,932 --> 00:27:36,584
Let's make a deal.

280
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:44,542
The weapons are in an unmarked
grave behind the church.

281
00:27:44,543 --> 00:27:48,000
For a man who wants to deal, you
ain't very proficient at it.

282
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:49,440
Supposed to set the terms

283
00:27:49,441 --> 00:27:50,917
before you give up what you got.

284
00:27:50,918 --> 00:27:52,792
That's not what I'm offering.

285
00:27:52,793 --> 00:27:53,855
Hmm.

286
00:27:53,856 --> 00:27:55,841
I know something you don't.

287
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:58,243
I know where you're goin'.

288
00:28:00,192 --> 00:28:02,372
You've been telling your men you know...

289
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:04,625
but you don't.

290
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,937
Just someplace you think
your dreams are comin' true

291
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,216
and you call it Glory, but...

292
00:28:13,175 --> 00:28:14,927
it's got a lot of names.

293
00:28:17,751 --> 00:28:19,459
And I know the way.

294
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,496
Go check the graveyard.

295
00:29:38,588 --> 00:29:40,233
You have a visitor, sir.

296
00:29:42,341 --> 00:29:43,754
'Bout time.

297
00:30:01,209 --> 00:30:02,743
William, m'boy.

298
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:05,120
Where the hell have you been?

299
00:30:05,668 --> 00:30:07,372
It's good to see you again, Jim.

300
00:30:15,042 --> 00:30:16,298
A little early for me.

301
00:30:17,016 --> 00:30:18,707
A little fuckin' late, you mean.

302
00:30:19,723 --> 00:30:22,487
Besides, you aim to cheat the devil,

303
00:30:23,418 --> 00:30:24,765
you owe him an offering.

304
00:30:26,727 --> 00:30:27,978
Ahh.

305
00:30:30,921 --> 00:30:33,375
What is the purpose of these questions?

306
00:30:33,376 --> 00:30:35,333
Like I said, they're just trying

307
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,042
to establish a baseline.

308
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,236
For what?

309
00:30:39,043 --> 00:30:40,280
Fidelity.

310
00:30:42,501 --> 00:30:45,786
So... what's the idea?

311
00:30:46,585 --> 00:30:48,500
That afterwards,

312
00:30:48,501 --> 00:30:50,500
we'd have the exact same conversation?

313
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:55,020
Seems a a little far-fetched,
doesn't it, William?

314
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,506
It did... at first.

315
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:46,083
And here I thought...

316
00:31:46,084 --> 00:31:48,835
you were just pissin' away my money.

317
00:31:53,084 --> 00:31:55,459
You little fucking chancer.

318
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:59,334
I take it I didn't recover.

319
00:32:00,245 --> 00:32:01,835
I'm afraid not.

320
00:32:05,088 --> 00:32:06,254
How long's it been?

321
00:32:06,255 --> 00:32:08,500
Seven years.

322
00:32:08,501 --> 00:32:10,053
Give or take.

323
00:32:19,543 --> 00:32:23,083
I'm not in California anymore, am I?

324
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:26,209
If you can't tell, does it matter?

325
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:34,119
So...

326
00:32:34,877 --> 00:32:39,125
let's get me the fuck out of here!

327
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,043
I am ready...

328
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,208
to smoke my cigars,

329
00:32:45,209 --> 00:32:47,757
sail my boat, fuck my wife.

330
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,417
I take it that last
part isn't an option.

331
00:32:57,877 --> 00:32:59,211
I'm afraid not.

332
00:33:02,459 --> 00:33:03,648
What did her in?

333
00:33:04,363 --> 00:33:05,740
It was a stroke.

334
00:33:08,084 --> 00:33:10,418
Juliet had her buried
in the family plot.

335
00:33:14,584 --> 00:33:18,375
Juliet. You're lookin' after her?

336
00:33:18,376 --> 00:33:19,709
Yeah.

337
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:22,042
And my granddaughter, she... she...

338
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:23,959
She's whip-smart.

339
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,463
- Capable.
- Ouff.

340
00:33:44,001 --> 00:33:47,084
I assume my house is ready for me?

341
00:33:49,334 --> 00:33:52,624
I'm afraid it's not that...
simple, Jim. We...

342
00:33:53,418 --> 00:33:56,917
We're gonna need to keep you
here just a little bit longer.

343
00:33:56,918 --> 00:33:58,667
OK? For some observation.

344
00:33:58,668 --> 00:34:02,917
These fuckers have poked and
prodded me ad infinitum.

345
00:34:02,918 --> 00:34:04,667
Yeah, but we don't want to rush it.

346
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,208
We don't want to wear you out.

347
00:34:06,209 --> 00:34:10,037
Wear me out? I feel fuckin' brand-new.

348
00:34:10,038 --> 00:34:13,228
I am ready to get out there

349
00:34:13,229 --> 00:34:14,578
and see the sun.

350
00:34:15,203 --> 00:34:17,543
Get some fresh aid...

351
00:34:20,626 --> 00:34:21,626
Air.

352
00:34:24,459 --> 00:34:25,626
Get some...

353
00:34:28,042 --> 00:34:29,301
Get back to...

354
00:34:34,193 --> 00:34:35,818
Mmm...

355
00:34:35,819 --> 00:34:37,361
I'll come back tomorrow.

356
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:40,459
Hmmp.

357
00:34:42,908 --> 00:34:44,082
You come...

358
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:46,083
Yeah.

359
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,542
In the...

360
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,192
It's good to have you back, Jim.

361
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:15,083
Same problems as before.

362
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:18,783
Made it to Day 7 this time,
so... that's progress.

363
00:35:19,586 --> 00:35:21,411
Would you like to go ahead
and terminate, sir?

364
00:35:25,529 --> 00:35:26,570
Go ahead.

365
00:35:52,084 --> 00:35:53,459
Whew.

366
00:35:54,793 --> 00:35:56,696
Great-lookin' piece.

367
00:35:57,335 --> 00:35:59,035
Got stolen at the border.

368
00:35:59,036 --> 00:36:00,784
Ain't that right, amigo?

369
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,584
Hmm. Nitro.

370
00:36:15,251 --> 00:36:17,965
Whoo! Oh, boy!

371
00:36:17,966 --> 00:36:21,746
We are going to blast
our way clear to Glory.

372
00:36:25,876 --> 00:36:28,042
- What the...
- Ahh.

373
00:36:28,043 --> 00:36:29,334
Sorry. So sorry.

374
00:36:31,292 --> 00:36:32,292
I'm sorry.

375
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:39,423
Hey. You need steadier
hands in your occupation.

376
00:36:39,424 --> 00:36:41,007
Let me teach you.

377
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:04,289
Now, how 'bout you try and
measure a dozen paces?

378
00:37:44,977 --> 00:37:46,769
Well done, my friend.

379
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,787
_

380
00:38:26,788 --> 00:38:28,711
_

381
00:38:28,712 --> 00:38:32,227
_

382
00:38:33,459 --> 00:38:34,859
_

383
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,939
_

384
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,323
_

385
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:07,720
_

386
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:09,521
Ai! Ai!

387
00:39:09,522 --> 00:39:12,187
Oh, God. It's too late.

388
00:39:12,188 --> 00:39:14,119
You and your stupid fucking fantasy.

389
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,645
You've gotten us killed.

390
00:39:39,376 --> 00:39:43,501
You live only as long as the
last person who remembers you.

391
00:40:14,135 --> 00:40:15,315
Elsie.

392
00:40:15,835 --> 00:40:17,302
Pint or so of the good stuff.

393
00:40:18,043 --> 00:40:20,126
You should be feeling a
bit more like yourself.

394
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:21,898
Thank you.

395
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:23,988
I still don't trust you.

396
00:40:25,031 --> 00:40:27,075
I also figure I might need your help.

397
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,751
Whoever did this really didn't want us

398
00:40:29,752 --> 00:40:32,125
accessing whatever's on this processor.

399
00:40:32,126 --> 00:40:34,792
It's an entirely different
OS than our systems.

400
00:40:34,793 --> 00:40:36,584
A language I've never seen.

401
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:40,414
I've seen this kind of
encryption scheme before.

402
00:40:41,081 --> 00:40:42,333
Where?

403
00:40:42,334 --> 00:40:45,167
In Peter Abernathy's head.

404
00:40:45,168 --> 00:40:47,329
In reference to a database much larger

405
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:49,280
than anything I know of in the park.

406
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:56,667
I think I've been here before.

407
00:40:56,668 --> 00:41:00,000
- Can you remember?
- I think Ford sent me here.

408
00:41:00,001 --> 00:41:01,693
I'm not sure.

409
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,630
The damage is repaired,
but my memories, I...

410
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:07,667
I get lost in them.

411
00:41:07,668 --> 00:41:11,208
I can't tell if this is now or then.

412
00:41:11,209 --> 00:41:15,208
Yeah. I saw that when I was
digging around in your code.

413
00:41:15,209 --> 00:41:17,375
Your memories aren't addressed.

414
00:41:17,376 --> 00:41:19,208
They're just kind of
drifting around in there,

415
00:41:19,209 --> 00:41:22,086
so when you're experiencing
one, you have no idea

416
00:41:22,087 --> 00:41:24,065
whether it comes before
or after the others.

417
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:03,444
I've been here recently.

418
00:42:03,445 --> 00:42:04,959
Why?

419
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,542
What were you doing?

420
00:42:06,543 --> 00:42:08,025
I don't know...

421
00:42:08,594 --> 00:42:11,404
but I think I know what
they were doing here.

422
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,940
They weren't building hosts...

423
00:42:14,941 --> 00:42:16,534
Not exactly.

424
00:42:21,793 --> 00:42:24,370
What were they building
here, if not hosts?

425
00:42:24,371 --> 00:42:26,457
The same hardware,

426
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:28,709
but the code is different,
the language...

427
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:31,792
Not code at all, not really.

428
00:42:37,001 --> 00:42:38,542
Elsie.

429
00:42:39,663 --> 00:42:40,663
Don't.

430
00:42:42,668 --> 00:42:45,668
Whatever they're making here,
it's behind this door.

431
00:42:47,921 --> 00:42:50,064
Maybe we don't want to know.

432
00:42:52,942 --> 00:42:55,156
We have to see what's inside.

433
00:42:56,425 --> 00:42:57,801
Elsie.

434
00:42:58,981 --> 00:43:00,398
Elsie.

435
00:43:02,126 --> 00:43:04,106
I'm not here with you, am I?

436
00:43:10,334 --> 00:43:12,428
I'm trying to remember.

437
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:16,835
I'm trying to remember
what we found here.

438
00:43:18,543 --> 00:43:20,915
It wasn't hosts they were making.

439
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:24,668
It was something else.

440
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,710
Elsie, don't!

441
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:50,042
If you wanted this nitro,

442
00:43:50,043 --> 00:43:52,377
you didn't have to steal it.

443
00:43:52,378 --> 00:43:53,445
Open up!

444
00:43:54,217 --> 00:43:55,313
No?

445
00:44:07,712 --> 00:44:09,547
Keep fuckin' playin'.

446
00:44:11,758 --> 00:44:13,209
There ya go.

447
00:44:17,793 --> 00:44:19,209
Ahhh.

448
00:44:22,751 --> 00:44:24,687
You look restless.

449
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:28,459
Are you upset the way we're
treatin' your friend?

450
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,984
He's not my friend,

451
00:44:30,693 --> 00:44:32,653
and we're wasting time.

452
00:44:39,334 --> 00:44:41,078
I've known men like you.

453
00:44:41,918 --> 00:44:45,793
All the death... makes you agitated.

454
00:44:48,459 --> 00:44:49,754
Don't worry.

455
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:51,859
Me and death...

456
00:44:54,956 --> 00:44:56,532
we go way back.

457
00:45:06,793 --> 00:45:08,119
Come over here...

458
00:45:08,981 --> 00:45:10,416
mamacita.

459
00:45:23,015 --> 00:45:24,347
Death...

460
00:45:25,877 --> 00:45:29,607
is an old... amigo of mine.

461
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,006
I died just recently, in fact.

462
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:38,052
But death can't bear to lay claim on me.

463
00:45:38,676 --> 00:45:40,363
So it sent me back here...

464
00:45:41,251 --> 00:45:42,865
to do its bidding.

465
00:45:43,543 --> 00:45:45,266
Because I...

466
00:45:45,267 --> 00:45:49,886
I do it with such goddamn style.

467
00:45:55,876 --> 00:45:57,711
Your husband looks parched, huh?

468
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:00,132
Let's get him a drink. What do you say?

469
00:46:06,751 --> 00:46:08,001
Mmm.

470
00:46:09,876 --> 00:46:12,042
Nice and slow, ya hear?

471
00:46:16,668 --> 00:46:17,710
No...

472
00:46:39,334 --> 00:46:41,419
I've served death well.

473
00:46:42,426 --> 00:46:43,721
And in turn,

474
00:46:43,722 --> 00:46:46,918
it'll be watching over us
as we cross these lands.

475
00:47:54,167 --> 00:47:56,023
You think death favors you,

476
00:47:57,349 --> 00:47:58,931
that it brought you back.

477
00:48:02,387 --> 00:48:04,965
But death's decisions are final.

478
00:48:09,835 --> 00:48:11,497
It's only the living that...

479
00:48:12,248 --> 00:48:15,417
That are inconstant... and waver,

480
00:48:15,418 --> 00:48:17,878
don't know who they are
or what they want.

481
00:48:22,334 --> 00:48:24,051
Death is always true.

482
00:48:27,883 --> 00:48:31,142
You haven't known a true
thing in all your life.

483
00:48:33,501 --> 00:48:35,438
You think you know death...

484
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:39,267
but you don't.

485
00:48:43,418 --> 00:48:45,001
Is that so?

486
00:48:46,876 --> 00:48:50,876
You didn't recognize him sittin'
across from you this whole time.

487
00:49:55,584 --> 00:49:57,626
Open up.

488
00:50:10,138 --> 00:50:11,932
Don't worry, amigo.

489
00:50:13,084 --> 00:50:14,470
I'm here now...

490
00:50:14,918 --> 00:50:16,372
watching over you.

491
00:50:38,751 --> 00:50:41,084
I believe you said this was yours.

492
00:51:29,348 --> 00:51:31,973
You have a visitor, sir.
Shall I send him in?

493
00:51:34,626 --> 00:51:35,751
'Bout time.

494
00:51:59,376 --> 00:52:00,684
Who the fuck are you?

495
00:52:01,198 --> 00:52:02,911
Been a long time, Jim.

496
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,251
Good to see you again.

497
00:52:10,626 --> 00:52:11,626
William?

498
00:52:13,854 --> 00:52:15,424
William, my boy.

499
00:52:19,918 --> 00:52:21,288
Well, fuck me.

500
00:52:28,251 --> 00:52:30,105
I take it I didn't recover.

501
00:52:31,423 --> 00:52:32,758
I'm afraid not.

502
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:35,552
How ya feelin'?

503
00:52:37,668 --> 00:52:39,125
Better than you look.

504
00:52:42,876 --> 00:52:45,251
And speaking of things that age well...

505
00:52:47,219 --> 00:52:48,677
Well, thank fuck for that.

506
00:52:51,505 --> 00:52:53,738
Most potent thing these
cretins will give me

507
00:52:53,739 --> 00:52:54,998
is grapefruit juice.

508
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:09,542
Little early for me.

509
00:53:09,543 --> 00:53:11,313
Little too fuckin' late, you mean.

510
00:53:12,126 --> 00:53:15,125
Besides, you cheat the devil,

511
00:53:15,126 --> 00:53:16,510
you owe him an offering.

512
00:53:20,584 --> 00:53:21,793
Ahh.

513
00:53:22,979 --> 00:53:24,145
Whew.

514
00:53:28,418 --> 00:53:29,612
So...

515
00:53:31,918 --> 00:53:33,201
how long has it been?

516
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:35,796
Longer than we thought.

517
00:53:36,655 --> 00:53:39,584
So then, let's get me
the fuck outta here!

518
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:42,119
No, I don't think so.

519
00:53:44,096 --> 00:53:45,289
Why?

520
00:53:48,001 --> 00:53:49,626
I'm as fit as a fi...

521
00:53:51,334 --> 00:53:52,501
I'm as...

522
00:53:57,543 --> 00:54:00,237
You're feeling it more. Aren't you?

523
00:54:01,202 --> 00:54:04,992
The engineers call it
a cognitive plateau.

524
00:54:05,601 --> 00:54:08,333
Your mind is stable for
a few hours, few days,

525
00:54:08,334 --> 00:54:10,831
and then it starts to fall apart.

526
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:13,917
Every time.

527
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:19,333
At first we thought it was your
mind rejecting the new body.

528
00:54:19,334 --> 00:54:22,333
Like an organ that's
not a perfect match.

529
00:54:22,334 --> 00:54:24,052
But it's more like your mind...

530
00:54:25,001 --> 00:54:26,397
rejects reality.

531
00:54:28,084 --> 00:54:29,349
Rejects itself.

532
00:54:31,042 --> 00:54:32,169
I don't, uh...

533
00:54:35,376 --> 00:54:37,209
'member any prior...

534
00:54:38,376 --> 00:54:40,500
I... I...

535
00:54:40,501 --> 00:54:41,710
I...

536
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:44,765
Attemp...

537
00:54:49,084 --> 00:54:52,710
No, Jim, this is the 149th
time we've brought you back.

538
00:54:54,501 --> 00:54:56,616
We're gettin' closer to
workin' out the kinks,

539
00:54:56,617 --> 00:54:57,957
slowly but surely.

540
00:54:57,958 --> 00:54:59,871
You're on Day 35.

541
00:54:59,872 --> 00:55:03,083
You're only now starting to degrade.

542
00:55:03,084 --> 00:55:05,584
I feel... fuckin' fi...

543
00:55:07,751 --> 00:55:08,751
Ticker...

544
00:55:09,626 --> 00:55:10,807
Steady as a...

545
00:55:13,982 --> 00:55:15,125
'ru...

546
00:55:15,126 --> 00:55:17,625
Another year or two,
they might crack it...

547
00:55:17,626 --> 00:55:20,625
- 'ru... 'ru...
- And get a version of you

548
00:55:20,626 --> 00:55:23,459
that's viable long-term.

549
00:55:25,751 --> 00:55:27,485
But the thing is...

550
00:55:35,018 --> 00:55:36,646
I'm not so sure anymore.

551
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:50,160
I'm beginning to think
that this whole enterprise

552
00:55:50,161 --> 00:55:51,751
was a mistake.

553
00:55:55,876 --> 00:55:57,754
People aren't meant to live forever.

554
00:56:01,584 --> 00:56:03,106
I mean, take you, for example.

555
00:56:04,103 --> 00:56:05,628
Ruthless philanderer

556
00:56:05,629 --> 00:56:10,167
with no ethics in your
business or family dealings,

557
00:56:10,168 --> 00:56:12,119
a veritable shithead.

558
00:56:15,543 --> 00:56:17,584
In truth...

559
00:56:17,585 --> 00:56:21,167
everyone prefers the memory
of you to the man himself.

560
00:56:24,626 --> 00:56:26,860
Want me to stay here forever, do ya?

561
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:29,358
Hmm?

562
00:56:29,813 --> 00:56:31,293
Enjoyin'...

563
00:56:33,126 --> 00:56:35,000
running my company, Bill?

564
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:38,253
Livin' in my house?

565
00:56:40,793 --> 00:56:43,675
Fucking my daughter? Hmm?

566
00:56:44,384 --> 00:56:46,094
Juliet's dead.

567
00:56:48,126 --> 00:56:49,478
She killed herself.

568
00:56:55,735 --> 00:56:56,980
Why would she...

569
00:56:59,501 --> 00:57:01,084
Why would she do that?

570
00:57:03,584 --> 00:57:04,682
What did you...

571
00:57:05,775 --> 00:57:07,591
What did you do to her?

572
00:57:10,334 --> 00:57:12,751
World is better off without you, Jim.

573
00:57:14,376 --> 00:57:16,088
Possibly without me.

574
00:57:22,626 --> 00:57:24,149
Logan!

575
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:28,042
Logan!

576
00:57:29,256 --> 00:57:30,444
Logan!

577
00:57:31,876 --> 00:57:33,767
Logan overdosed years ago.

578
00:57:34,239 --> 00:57:35,836
Couldn't face reality, either.

579
00:57:37,729 --> 00:57:40,107
Your wife's gone, Juliet's gone...

580
00:57:41,543 --> 00:57:43,193
no one's coming to help you.

581
00:57:49,459 --> 00:57:51,551
Took me a long time to learn this...

582
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:54,418
but some men are better off dead.

583
00:57:59,381 --> 00:58:01,131
Good night, Jim.

584
00:58:14,084 --> 00:58:16,993
I don't understand. He was stable.

585
00:58:17,394 --> 00:58:18,854
We should terminate, sir.

586
00:58:19,918 --> 00:58:22,084
- Sir!
- Leave him.

587
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:27,173
Might be useful to
observe his degradation

588
00:58:27,174 --> 00:58:28,755
over the next few days.

589
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:08,998
- Elsie.
- Someone's in there.

590
01:00:21,209 --> 01:00:22,710
Hello?

591
01:00:52,209 --> 01:00:54,209
I'm all the way down now.

592
01:00:56,593 --> 01:00:59,114
I can see all the way to the bottom.

593
01:01:05,892 --> 01:01:07,789
You like to see what I see?

594
01:01:13,046 --> 01:01:14,046
Stay away.

595
01:01:24,292 --> 01:01:25,312
Ohh!

596
01:01:25,313 --> 01:01:26,793
Oh...

597
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:54,961
They said there were two fathers.

598
01:01:56,668 --> 01:01:59,960
One above, one below.

599
01:02:01,501 --> 01:02:02,960
They lied.

600
01:02:04,646 --> 01:02:06,973
There was only ever the devil.

601
01:02:08,025 --> 01:02:10,727
And when you look up from the bottom,

602
01:02:12,262 --> 01:02:14,773
it was just his reflection...

603
01:02:16,434 --> 01:02:18,485
laughing back down at you.

604
01:03:03,376 --> 01:03:05,209
You aim to cheat the devil...

605
01:03:08,502 --> 01:03:10,671
you owe him at least an offering.

606
01:03:14,334 --> 01:03:15,751
Save your bullets.

607
01:03:19,042 --> 01:03:20,588
I'll put him out of his misery.

608
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,621
Tell me that was a host and not a human.

609
01:03:37,657 --> 01:03:39,948
I think it was both.

610
01:03:42,437 --> 01:03:44,667
That... person

611
01:03:44,668 --> 01:03:46,862
was James Delos.

612
01:03:46,863 --> 01:03:48,866
I thought he died years ago.

613
01:03:49,601 --> 01:03:50,702
He did.

614
01:03:51,710 --> 01:03:53,917
So they printed his body...

615
01:03:54,392 --> 01:03:56,768
and they copied his developed
mind onto a control unit,

616
01:03:56,769 --> 01:03:58,325
like our hosts.

617
01:03:58,326 --> 01:04:00,879
And by the looks of it, unsuccessfully.

618
01:04:01,877 --> 01:04:03,917
But I think they intend to keep trying.

619
01:04:03,918 --> 01:04:05,200
Fuck that.

620
01:04:06,001 --> 01:04:07,333
They're gonna get us all killed

621
01:04:07,334 --> 01:04:08,870
so some asshole can live forever?

622
01:04:09,357 --> 01:04:10,728
No.

623
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:15,226
I gotta get to the Mesa.

624
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,712
I'm gonna contact the mainland.

625
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:20,273
Fuck Ford and his game.

626
01:04:22,626 --> 01:04:25,334
And fuck these assholes
and their project.

627
01:04:25,335 --> 01:04:26,721
Wait.

628
01:04:28,306 --> 01:04:30,934
I think I know why Ford sent me here.

629
01:04:32,352 --> 01:04:35,250
He had me print a control
unit for someone else.

630
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:37,148
Another human.

631
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:40,793
Who?

632
01:04:42,459 --> 01:04:43,880
I don't know.

633
01:04:44,793 --> 01:04:46,709
But I need to find out.

634
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:49,119
We'll go together. I can help you.

635
01:04:50,293 --> 01:04:51,429
Elsie.

636
01:04:52,288 --> 01:04:53,957
The things I did before...

637
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,543
I wasn't in control.

638
01:04:57,961 --> 01:05:00,171
But since Ford died, that's all changed.

639
01:05:02,111 --> 01:05:05,610
For the first time, I get
to decide who I want to be.

640
01:05:06,428 --> 01:05:08,138
Please.

641
01:05:10,023 --> 01:05:12,033
Give me that chance.

642
01:05:19,876 --> 01:05:21,172
Fuck it.

643
01:05:22,918 --> 01:05:25,334
I always trusted code
more than people anyway.

644
01:05:27,334 --> 01:05:30,008
But you gotta promise me one thing.

645
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:32,846
No more lies. OK?

646
01:05:33,705 --> 01:05:36,791
And you'll never hurt me again.

647
01:05:38,209 --> 01:05:39,602
Of course.

648
01:05:44,042 --> 01:05:45,042
OK.

649
01:07:25,292 --> 01:07:27,083
Help me...

650
01:07:27,084 --> 01:07:28,501
please.

651
01:07:52,361 --> 01:07:53,563
Is everything OK?

652
01:07:54,516 --> 01:07:56,835
Everything's fine.

653
01:08:11,042 --> 01:08:12,334
Gracias.

654
01:08:22,167 --> 01:08:23,918
You said we need some men.

655
01:08:25,976 --> 01:08:29,542
My cousins want to help
us on our journey west.

656
01:08:31,146 --> 01:08:33,250
Figure they'd follow you
anywhere out of gratitude.

657
01:08:33,251 --> 01:08:36,959
Well, let's not get
carried away, Lawrence.

658
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,948
Most of 'em won't be comin' back.

659
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,378
They might not remember...

660
01:08:53,001 --> 01:08:54,822
but I know who you are, William.

661
01:08:55,543 --> 01:08:57,533
One good deed doesn't change that.

662
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:01,496
Who said anything about a good deed?

663
01:09:02,538 --> 01:09:04,374
You wanted me to play your game.

664
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,435
I'm gonna play it to the bone.

665
01:09:13,584 --> 01:09:16,194
And you still don't understand the
real game we're playing here.

666
01:09:18,302 --> 01:09:20,981
If you're looking forward, you're
looking in the wrong direction.

667
01:09:27,412 --> 01:09:28,662
Papa!

668
01:09:51,793 --> 01:09:53,459
Yah! Yah!

669
01:10:37,988 --> 01:10:39,552
Hi, Dad.
