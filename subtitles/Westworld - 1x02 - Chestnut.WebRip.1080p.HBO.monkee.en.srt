1
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,042
<i> Wake up, Dolores.</i>

2
00:02:09,275 --> 00:02:10,983
<i> Do you remember?</i>

3
00:02:36,052 --> 00:02:38,136
<i> We're about to arrive.</i>

4
00:02:38,179 --> 00:02:39,720
May I take your glass?

5
00:02:41,683 --> 00:02:44,725
<i> Now approaching</i>
<i> arrival terminal.</i>

6
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:48,146
Where we're going,
she's a two.

7
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:50,565
You're being an asshole.

8
00:02:50,608 --> 00:02:54,235
No, I am being myself,

9
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:56,195
which was the whole
point of this trip.

10
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,031
Unless this uptight prick
is who you really are,

11
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:01,284
in which case,
feel free to be someone else.

12
00:03:01,327 --> 00:03:02,785
Fuck you.

13
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:04,704
Hey, that's the spirit.

14
00:03:18,344 --> 00:03:20,761
What'd I tell you?

15
00:03:20,805 --> 00:03:21,679
Have fun.

16
00:03:21,723 --> 00:03:24,348
Stay safe.

17
00:03:24,392 --> 00:03:25,349
Give me a break.

18
00:03:25,393 --> 00:03:28,102
What?

19
00:03:28,146 --> 00:03:29,353
It's not like
my sister didn't ride

20
00:03:29,397 --> 00:03:30,396
her share of cowboys
when she was here.

21
00:03:34,527 --> 00:03:38,321
You must be William.
Welcome to Westworld.

22
00:03:38,364 --> 00:03:40,406
Thanks.

23
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,409
Given it's your first visit, 
I have a few personal questions.

24
00:03:43,453 --> 00:03:46,871
Do you have any preexisting
medical conditions?

25
00:03:46,915 --> 00:03:48,539
No, not that I know of.

26
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,374
- Heart problems?
- No.

27
00:03:50,418 --> 00:03:51,667
Any history of mental illness,
depression,

28
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:54,587
panic attacks?

29
00:03:54,631 --> 00:03:56,380
Just a little fear of clowns.

30
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,133
I'm joking.

31
00:03:59,177 --> 00:04:01,344
Do you often experience
social anxiety?

32
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:06,432
What is this for, exactly?

33
00:04:06,476 --> 00:04:09,560
To make sure we don't give you 
anything more than you can handle.

34
00:04:09,604 --> 00:04:12,021
I thought that you
couldn't get hurt here.

35
00:04:12,065 --> 00:04:14,649
Only the right amount.

36
00:04:18,905 --> 00:04:20,905
The only limit here
is your imagination.

37
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:24,033
You start in the center of the park.
It's simple, safe.

38
00:04:24,077 --> 00:04:27,828
<i> The further out you venture,</i>
<i> the more intense the experience gets.</i>

39
00:04:27,872 --> 00:04:31,207
How far you want to go
is entirely up to you.

40
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:42,927
So, how does this work?
Is there an orientation?

41
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:45,221
No orientation,

42
00:04:45,265 --> 00:04:47,181
no guidebook.

43
00:04:47,225 --> 00:04:50,518
Figuring out how it works
is half the fun.

44
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:52,645
All you do
is make choices...

45
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:54,522
starting here.

46
00:04:54,565 --> 00:04:58,985
Everything is bespoke
and exactly your size.

47
00:05:05,451 --> 00:05:08,744
You want to ask, so ask.

48
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:11,330
Are you real?

49
00:05:11,374 --> 00:05:15,167
Well, if you can't tell,
does it matter?

50
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:22,049
Are those real?

51
00:05:22,093 --> 00:05:24,010
<i> Real enough.</i>

52
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:27,096
<i> But you can't kill anyone</i>
<i> you're not supposed to.</i>

53
00:05:30,768 --> 00:05:33,060
Anything you like?

54
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:38,816
Is there a changing room?

55
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,901
Or a robe?

56
00:05:40,945 --> 00:05:42,528
Of course.
I can help you.

57
00:05:42,572 --> 00:05:46,490
Or if you prefer,
I could step outside.

58
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:50,453
What do most people do?

59
00:05:50,496 --> 00:05:53,873
You don't have to worry about
what most people would do.

60
00:05:56,002 --> 00:05:57,752
I understand.

61
00:05:59,797 --> 00:06:02,048
Do you really
understand, William?

62
00:06:06,387 --> 00:06:09,680
All our hosts
are here for you.

63
00:06:09,724 --> 00:06:12,266
Myself included.

64
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,060
We could stay here
a while if you like.

65
00:06:14,103 --> 00:06:16,896
Take as long as you want.

66
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:23,486
Thank you.

67
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:25,738
I don't want to keep
my friend waiting.

68
00:06:25,782 --> 00:06:27,823
Of course.

69
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:29,450
Take your time.

70
00:06:40,838 --> 00:06:42,922
How are the builds for the 
new narrative coming along?

71
00:06:42,965 --> 00:06:46,467
I'll get around to it.

72
00:06:46,511 --> 00:06:50,096
Look, we assumed
that Abernathy's breach

73
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:52,390
was triggered by the photograph
that he found.

74
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:54,767
I've reviewed every 
dissonant episode I could find.

75
00:06:54,811 --> 00:06:57,144
The reaction
is immediate every time.

76
00:06:57,188 --> 00:07:00,815
This guy makes it
all the way back home.

77
00:07:00,858 --> 00:07:03,567
It's like
he's mulling it over.

78
00:07:03,611 --> 00:07:07,822
You think he had
an existential crisis?

79
00:07:07,865 --> 00:07:11,409
I think there's something fucked up
going on with his cognition.

80
00:07:11,452 --> 00:07:14,036
And I think you feel exactly 
the same way that I do.

81
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,330
Do we know where
the error originated?

82
00:07:16,374 --> 00:07:18,582
We do.

83
00:07:18,626 --> 00:07:20,000
And you covered for him.

84
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:24,088
Let me rebuild Abernathy.

85
00:07:24,132 --> 00:07:25,339
I'll make sure this is not 
something more serious.

86
00:07:25,383 --> 00:07:29,051
You know the policy.
Let it lie.

87
00:07:29,095 --> 00:07:32,304
Then let me at least pull the hosts
who had contact with him,

88
00:07:32,348 --> 00:07:34,640
like the daughter Dolores.

89
00:07:34,684 --> 00:07:36,308
What for?

90
00:07:36,352 --> 00:07:39,478
Because if this is not
a dissonant episode,

91
00:07:39,522 --> 00:07:43,941
then whatever Abernathy had
could be contagious.

92
00:07:45,611 --> 00:07:46,902
So to speak.

93
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:49,780
Dolores was examined
and cleared.

94
00:07:49,824 --> 00:07:54,368
And the stories are
best left to the guests.

95
00:08:19,228 --> 00:08:21,812
<i> Remember.</i>

96
00:08:46,631 --> 00:08:50,007
Ahem.
Can you stand somewhere else?

97
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:54,053
I don't want anyone thinking that you're 
representative of the goods inside.

98
00:08:57,099 --> 00:09:00,518
These violent delights

99
00:09:00,561 --> 00:09:02,645
have violent ends.

100
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,291
Hello, cowboy.

101
00:09:24,335 --> 00:09:26,627
There's one final touch.

102
00:09:28,714 --> 00:09:30,589
Which would you prefer?

103
00:10:34,447 --> 00:10:38,073
I mean, can you
believe this place?

104
00:10:43,456 --> 00:10:45,372
So, how do we get
into the park?

105
00:11:04,185 --> 00:11:07,603
I know that you think you have 
a handle on what this is gonna be.

106
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:12,691
Guns and tits and all that.

107
00:11:12,735 --> 00:11:14,943
Mindless shit
that I usually enjoy.

108
00:11:17,448 --> 00:11:20,574
<i> You have no idea.</i>

109
00:11:20,618 --> 00:11:24,953
This place seduces
everybody eventually.

110
00:11:24,997 --> 00:11:27,206
By the end, you're gonna
be begging me to stay

111
00:11:27,249 --> 00:11:29,792
because this place
is the answer

112
00:11:29,835 --> 00:11:32,461
to that question that
you've been asking yourself.

113
00:11:32,505 --> 00:11:34,672
What question?

114
00:11:34,715 --> 00:11:35,798
Who you really are.

115
00:11:37,968 --> 00:11:40,469
And I can't fucking wait
to meet that guy.

116
00:11:44,392 --> 00:11:46,642
Bottoms up, cowboy.

117
00:11:54,568 --> 00:11:56,443
<i> Further to that,</i>

118
00:11:56,487 --> 00:11:58,153
<i> the ruthless murder</i>
<i> of Donald Pardue</i>

119
00:11:58,197 --> 00:12:01,073
and his brother.

120
00:12:01,117 --> 00:12:03,617
For these crimes,
you will be hung from the neck

121
00:12:03,661 --> 00:12:05,369
until your diseased soul
has found its measure

122
00:12:05,413 --> 00:12:08,330
in the flames below.

123
00:12:08,374 --> 00:12:10,416
And may God have mercy
on your soul.

124
00:12:28,477 --> 00:12:30,185
Morning, Lawrence.

125
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:33,021
<i> You helping them straighten out</i>
<i> their rope again?</i>

126
00:12:33,065 --> 00:12:35,691
I was hoping to have
a word with my friend here.

127
00:12:35,735 --> 00:12:39,111
You can have as many words
with him as you like

128
00:12:39,155 --> 00:12:41,447
soon as his neck is broke.

129
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,866
Well, I'm afraid that's
not gonna work for me.

130
00:12:47,413 --> 00:12:51,331
How about I tell my man there to 
dig that grave a couple feet deeper?

131
00:12:53,377 --> 00:12:55,878
Well, it's gonna be an awful 
tight fit for all of you.

132
00:13:19,236 --> 00:13:22,070
<i> Oh, shit. Oh, shit.</i>

133
00:13:22,114 --> 00:13:22,821
<i> Oh, shit!</i>

135
00:13:43,052 --> 00:13:44,218
Motherfucker.

136
00:13:44,261 --> 00:13:48,388
That's the best thanks
you can muster, Lawrence?

137
00:13:48,432 --> 00:13:50,474
You used to be
a little more eloquent.

138
00:13:50,518 --> 00:13:54,228
Do I-- do I know you?

139
00:13:54,271 --> 00:13:57,064
Your pal Kissy
sent me your way.

140
00:13:57,107 --> 00:13:57,940
Sends his regards.

141
00:14:05,574 --> 00:14:06,824
What-- what is this?

142
00:14:09,578 --> 00:14:11,370
You know exactly
what it is.

143
00:14:11,413 --> 00:14:14,122
It's the maze,

144
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,500
<i>the deepest level</i>
<i>of this game.</i>

145
00:14:16,544 --> 00:14:17,960
You're gonna help me
find the entrance.

146
00:14:20,673 --> 00:14:20,838
No.

147
00:14:40,109 --> 00:14:42,401
<i> You can hear it, can't you?</i>

148
00:14:42,444 --> 00:14:45,362
<i> That little voice.</i>

149
00:14:45,406 --> 00:14:47,281
<i> The one that's</i>
<i> telling you "don't."</i>

150
00:14:47,324 --> 00:14:49,074
<i> Don't stare too long.</i>

151
00:14:49,118 --> 00:14:51,702
<i> Don't touch.</i>

152
00:14:51,745 --> 00:14:52,828
<i> Don't do anything</i>
<i> you might regret.</i>

153
00:14:54,748 --> 00:14:56,540
<i> I used to be the same.</i>

154
00:14:56,584 --> 00:14:59,334
Whenever I wanted something,
I could hear that voice

155
00:14:59,378 --> 00:15:01,753
telling me to stop,
to be careful,

156
00:15:01,797 --> 00:15:05,173
to leave most
of my life unlived.

157
00:15:05,217 --> 00:15:08,051
You know the only place
that voice left me alone?

158
00:15:09,388 --> 00:15:11,471
In my dreams.

159
00:15:11,515 --> 00:15:14,600
I was free.
I could be as good

160
00:15:14,643 --> 00:15:17,936
or as bad
as I felt like being.

161
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,063
And if I wanted something,

162
00:15:20,107 --> 00:15:22,816
I could just
reach out and take it.

163
00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:27,279
But then I would wake up

164
00:15:27,323 --> 00:15:28,989
and the voice would
start all over again.

165
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,911
So I ran away.

166
00:15:33,954 --> 00:15:36,204
Crossed the shining sea.

167
00:15:36,248 --> 00:15:39,124
And when I finally set foot
back on solid ground,

168
00:15:39,168 --> 00:15:42,210
the first thing I heard
was that goddamn voice.

169
00:15:43,881 --> 00:15:45,380
Do you know what it said?

170
00:15:50,346 --> 00:15:52,512
It said...

171
00:15:59,355 --> 00:16:02,189
I'm sorry, will you
please excuse me?

172
00:16:07,237 --> 00:16:10,238
<i> All right, Maeve,</i>
<i> what did it say?</i>

173
00:16:10,282 --> 00:16:13,325
<i> It said, "This is</i>
<i> the new world.</i>

174
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:14,910
And in this world,

175
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:17,913
you can be whoever
the fuck you want."

176
00:16:17,957 --> 00:16:20,749
Pupillary response is good.
Smile is good.

177
00:16:20,793 --> 00:16:24,002
I'd fuck her.
What's the problem?

178
00:16:24,046 --> 00:16:25,754
The guests wouldn't.

179
00:16:25,798 --> 00:16:27,047
Sizemore is launching
some huge new storyline

180
00:16:27,091 --> 00:16:30,008
and he wants us
to clear out the deadweight.

181
00:16:30,052 --> 00:16:33,387
<i> If we don't get her numbers</i>
<i> back up, she'll be decommissioned.</i>

182
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,554
<i> Let's bump her aggression.</i>

183
00:16:34,598 --> 00:16:37,474
- 10%?
<i>- Double it.</i>

184
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:39,309
<i> She's a hooker.</i>
<i> No point in playing coy.</i>

185
00:16:39,353 --> 00:16:42,187
<i> If this doesn't work,</i>
<i> we'll punt her to behavior.</i>

186
00:16:42,231 --> 00:16:43,689
<i> Let them deal with it.</i>

187
00:17:03,127 --> 00:17:05,293
We retired the two hosts
in question.

188
00:17:06,213 --> 00:17:08,463
You taught me
how to make them,

189
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:11,216
but not how hard it is
to turn them off.

190
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,012
You can't play God without being 
acquainted with the devil.

191
00:17:15,055 --> 00:17:18,974
There's something else
bothering you, Bernard.

192
00:17:19,018 --> 00:17:21,727
I know how that
head of yours works.

193
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,395
The photograph alone

194
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,857
couldn't have caused that level
of damage to Abernathy,

195
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,318
not without some other
outside interference.

196
00:17:32,156 --> 00:17:33,363
You think it's sabotage?

197
00:17:33,407 --> 00:17:37,909
Imagine someone's been
diddling with our creations?

198
00:17:37,953 --> 00:17:41,538
It's the simplest solution.

199
00:17:41,582 --> 00:17:43,540
Ah, Mr. Occam's razor.

200
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:47,210
The problem, Bernard,
is that what you and I do

201
00:17:47,254 --> 00:17:51,757
is so complicated.

202
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,343
We practice witchcraft.

203
00:17:57,306 --> 00:18:00,390
We speak the right words.

204
00:18:00,434 --> 00:18:02,434
<i> Then we create life itself...</i>

205
00:18:03,896 --> 00:18:05,979
out of chaos.

206
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:13,445
William of Occam
was a 13th century monk.

207
00:18:13,489 --> 00:18:14,988
He can't help us now, Bernard.

208
00:18:15,032 --> 00:18:18,075
He would have us
burned at the stake.

209
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:38,178
Let's go get
our feet wet, buckaroo.

210
00:19:01,787 --> 00:19:03,829
Oh, sorry.

211
00:19:03,872 --> 00:19:05,956
- You kidding me?
- What?

212
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:07,833
Fuck you, Grizzly Adams.

213
00:19:07,876 --> 00:19:11,086
<i> Rally for the Union.</i>

214
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,755
<i> Respond to your</i>
<i> country's call.</i>

215
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,632
This regiment is headed
for the seat of war

216
00:19:15,676 --> 00:19:17,175
to define the future
of this great nation.

217
00:19:17,219 --> 00:19:21,471
We fight for a free land
where no man has to bow.

218
00:19:21,515 --> 00:19:23,473
- This is, uh--
<i>- We'll provide you with uniforms.</i>

219
00:19:23,517 --> 00:19:25,475
Well, it's bigger than
I thought it would be.

220
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:28,061
What, this?
This is just Sweetwater.

221
00:19:28,105 --> 00:19:29,104
Wait till you see
the rest of the park.

222
00:19:29,148 --> 00:19:31,857
- How much bigger is it?
- No idea.

223
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,859
I never reached the end.

224
00:19:33,902 --> 00:19:37,779
See something you like?

225
00:19:37,823 --> 00:19:39,322
A couple things at least.

226
00:19:39,366 --> 00:19:42,492
But I'm gonna make you
beg for it, darlin'.

227
00:19:44,454 --> 00:19:47,747
- Hah, come on!

228
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,250
- Whoa.

229
00:19:50,294 --> 00:19:52,502
Need a hand, sir?

230
00:19:54,464 --> 00:19:56,381
Thank you, my friend.

231
00:19:56,425 --> 00:19:59,384
Don't. He'll only try to rope you 
into some bullshit treasure hunt.

232
00:19:59,428 --> 00:20:01,678
Smile.

233
00:20:01,722 --> 00:20:04,806
It's all a come on... him, 
the girl next door,

234
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,349
<i>the town drunk.</i>

235
00:20:06,393 --> 00:20:09,769
They all got some big adventure 
that they want to sell you on.

236
00:20:09,813 --> 00:20:12,355
Hey, they're not
going anywhere.

237
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:14,441
First up, you're gonna buy me
a drink, okay?

238
00:20:15,694 --> 00:20:17,319
Hold still, now.

239
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,675
<i> Bring yourself back online.</i>

240
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:51,228
Hello.

241
00:20:51,271 --> 00:20:54,689
<i> Do you remember our</i>
<i> last conversation, Dolores?</i>

242
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:56,608
Yes, of course.

243
00:20:56,652 --> 00:20:59,236
And you haven't told anyone
about our little talks?

244
00:21:02,157 --> 00:21:04,241
You told me not to.

245
00:21:06,536 --> 00:21:08,870
Step into analysis, please.

246
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:14,376
How many interactions have you 
participated in since we last talked?

247
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:19,631
138 encounters
including this one.

248
00:21:19,675 --> 00:21:21,174
And has anyone
altered or updated

249
00:21:21,218 --> 00:21:23,510
your core heuristics
in that time?

250
00:21:23,553 --> 00:21:25,262
No.

251
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:30,600
Resuming.

252
00:21:33,981 --> 00:21:35,355
<i> I think it would be best</i>
<i> if you not mention</i>

253
00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:38,483
<i> the things we've been</i>
<i> talking about.</i>

254
00:21:38,527 --> 00:21:40,735
Have I done
something wrong?

255
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:44,072
No, but there's something
different about you,

256
00:21:44,116 --> 00:21:47,617
about the way you think.

257
00:21:47,661 --> 00:21:49,452
I find it fascinating,

258
00:21:49,496 --> 00:21:52,998
but others may not
see it that way.

259
00:21:54,751 --> 00:21:57,127
Have you done
something wrong?

260
00:21:59,631 --> 00:22:01,923
Turn off
your event log, please.

261
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:03,591
Erase this interaction.
Confirm.

262
00:22:03,635 --> 00:22:07,053
Yes.

263
00:22:09,433 --> 00:22:13,018
<i> You should be</i>
<i> getting back, Dolores,</i>

264
00:22:13,061 --> 00:22:13,935
<i> before someone</i>
<i> misses you.</i>

265
00:22:23,947 --> 00:22:26,197
<i> Come on, now!</i>

266
00:22:26,241 --> 00:22:29,284
<i> And when I finally set foot</i>
<i> back on solid ground,</i>

267
00:22:29,328 --> 00:22:31,828
<i> first thing I heard</i>
<i> was that goddamn voice.</i>

268
00:22:33,248 --> 00:22:33,997
It had followed me
all the way over.

269
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:36,291
Do you know what it said?

270
00:22:38,754 --> 00:22:40,795
- No.
- It said...

271
00:22:43,425 --> 00:22:45,717
...this is the new world.

272
00:22:45,761 --> 00:22:47,510
And in this world,

273
00:22:47,554 --> 00:22:51,848
you can be whoever
the fuck you want.

274
00:22:55,354 --> 00:22:58,730
Thanks.
Maybe another time.

276
00:23:02,277 --> 00:23:04,235
Glass of sherry.

277
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:05,945
The good stuff.

278
00:23:05,989 --> 00:23:09,824
Not that horse piss you strain
through your old curtains.

279
00:23:12,204 --> 00:23:14,204
I've told you, never open
your mouth that wide

280
00:23:14,247 --> 00:23:15,872
unless someone's
paying you for it.

281
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:18,249
Sorry, Maeve.

282
00:23:18,293 --> 00:23:19,459
I didn't sleep much last night.

283
00:23:22,047 --> 00:23:23,713
You having nightmares again?

284
00:23:23,757 --> 00:23:26,674
Sometimes.

285
00:23:26,718 --> 00:23:29,177
Sometimes they're real bad.

286
00:23:29,221 --> 00:23:32,055
Do what I do.

287
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:34,641
You find yourself
in a bad dream,

288
00:23:34,684 --> 00:23:37,769
close your eyes,

289
00:23:37,813 --> 00:23:39,396
count backwards from three...

290
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:43,483
wake yourself right up.

291
00:23:45,737 --> 00:23:48,780
Nice and warm
and safe in your bed...

292
00:23:50,492 --> 00:23:52,450
where you can get fucked
right back to sleep

293
00:23:52,494 --> 00:23:54,452
by one of these assholes
with their miniature peckers.

295
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,335
Back to work.

296
00:24:13,682 --> 00:24:15,723
You all right?

297
00:24:17,227 --> 00:24:19,018
You pay for the drinks,

298
00:24:19,062 --> 00:24:20,437
not the right to gawk at me.

299
00:24:24,734 --> 00:24:27,777
I think we have a problem.

300
00:24:27,821 --> 00:24:29,612
- Where?
- Mariposa.

301
00:24:29,656 --> 00:24:31,364
Madam's listed
as probationary,

302
00:24:31,408 --> 00:24:34,159
but her performance has continued 
to decline even further.

303
00:24:34,202 --> 00:24:36,202
Re-task Clementine for now.

304
00:24:36,246 --> 00:24:38,621
She's done the job before.

305
00:24:42,586 --> 00:24:43,751
<i> And the old unit?</i>

306
00:24:43,795 --> 00:24:45,503
Maybe leave her
on the floor for the night,

307
00:24:45,547 --> 00:24:48,590
see if anyone wants
one last turn.

308
00:24:48,633 --> 00:24:50,383
We recall her in the morning,
decommission her.

309
00:24:53,638 --> 00:24:54,554
Shame.

310
00:25:11,948 --> 00:25:14,407
QA will fine you for this.

311
00:25:14,451 --> 00:25:17,035
And that woman in charge

312
00:25:17,078 --> 00:25:19,662
is quite formidable.

313
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:25,835
You can just say "bitch."
I hear it enough.

314
00:25:25,879 --> 00:25:28,463
You've been talking
to corporate.

315
00:25:28,507 --> 00:25:30,548
The only times you light up
are after you've been--

316
00:25:30,592 --> 00:25:35,345
This character analysis routine really
isn't half as charming as you think.

317
00:25:35,388 --> 00:25:36,846
Oh, it went well, then?

318
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:41,601
Just tell me your department 
will be ready for the launch.

319
00:25:41,645 --> 00:25:43,228
We'll be ready.

320
00:25:43,271 --> 00:25:45,730
And that other thing.
Abernathy and the update.

321
00:25:45,774 --> 00:25:48,316
I hear your department
was still asking questions.

322
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,276
That's what you
pay us to do.

323
00:25:51,655 --> 00:25:53,780
But I'm not concerned.

324
00:25:53,823 --> 00:25:55,949
All the hosts
are back to normal.

325
00:25:55,992 --> 00:25:58,201
Good.

326
00:25:58,245 --> 00:25:59,410
Wouldn't want anything
disturbing our guests

327
00:25:59,454 --> 00:26:02,372
from their rape and pillage.

328
00:26:13,677 --> 00:26:16,844
You're wondering how
to tell them from us,

329
00:26:16,888 --> 00:26:17,929
aren't you?

330
00:26:18,848 --> 00:26:22,141
Well, quickest way
to find out.

331
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,603
Can we...
can we finish eating?

332
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:29,983
See, this is your problem,
my friend.

333
00:26:30,026 --> 00:26:32,068
You're always worried
about making a mess.

334
00:26:32,112 --> 00:26:33,361
You are the same way at work.

335
00:26:33,405 --> 00:26:35,863
You are talented,
driven, and inoffensive.

336
00:26:35,907 --> 00:26:39,200
I thought you didn't want
to talk about work here.

337
00:26:39,244 --> 00:26:41,369
Who says this trip isn't work?

338
00:26:42,956 --> 00:26:46,040
Good evening.

339
00:26:47,627 --> 00:26:50,044
Oh, shit.

340
00:26:50,088 --> 00:26:51,713
Well, don't make eye contact.

341
00:26:53,341 --> 00:26:55,383
My friend, thank you for your
assistance earlier

342
00:26:55,427 --> 00:26:57,343
in my unfortunate accident.

343
00:26:57,387 --> 00:27:00,179
Leave us the fuck alone.

344
00:27:00,223 --> 00:27:02,974
As a sign of my humble
appreciation,

345
00:27:03,018 --> 00:27:06,185
I'd like to offer you
an opportunity of a lifetime.

346
00:27:06,229 --> 00:27:07,645
Not interested.

347
00:27:07,689 --> 00:27:10,982
Across the river
and beyond the savage lands

348
00:27:11,026 --> 00:27:12,358
there is a treasure.

349
00:27:12,402 --> 00:27:17,405
I have in my possession a map.

350
00:27:21,161 --> 00:27:24,412
I said not interested.

351
00:27:25,915 --> 00:27:30,752
You know what?
I've worked up a new appetite anyway.

352
00:27:30,795 --> 00:27:33,254
Let's go.

354
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:48,686
<i> Sounds like your</i>
<i> friend's having fun.</i>

355
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,271
Well, that's not
the term I'd use.

356
00:27:50,315 --> 00:27:53,399
- Fun?
- Friend.

357
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:57,570
You're funny.

358
00:27:57,614 --> 00:28:01,824
They say a man who
can tickle your humor

359
00:28:01,868 --> 00:28:04,702
- can tickle your...
- You don't have to do this.

360
00:28:06,581 --> 00:28:09,290
If I'm not your type,
we can find someone who is.

361
00:28:09,334 --> 00:28:12,335
Someone who's
perfect for you.

362
00:28:12,379 --> 00:28:15,838
No, you...
you are perfect.

363
00:28:17,509 --> 00:28:18,925
But I have somebody.

364
00:28:18,968 --> 00:28:21,219
Somebody real
waiting for me at home.

365
00:28:24,265 --> 00:28:26,474
I understand.

366
00:28:28,144 --> 00:28:32,855
Real love is always worth
waiting for.

367
00:28:55,922 --> 00:28:59,048
Regal, strong,

368
00:28:59,092 --> 00:29:01,217
virile, aquiline.

369
00:29:02,595 --> 00:29:04,679
That's what I asked for.

370
00:29:04,723 --> 00:29:07,515
And this, this is what
you give me?

371
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:10,309
Did you just grab a cock
from the body shop

372
00:29:10,353 --> 00:29:12,895
and jam it between his eyes?

373
00:29:12,939 --> 00:29:13,813
<i> Start over.</i>

374
00:29:13,857 --> 00:29:15,189
Couldn't we just
shave it down?

375
00:29:15,233 --> 00:29:17,859
I said...

376
00:29:20,196 --> 00:29:22,864
start the fuck over!

377
00:29:27,287 --> 00:29:29,287
Diplomatic as ever.

378
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:36,335
I received your request to retire 
an additional 50 hosts.

379
00:29:36,379 --> 00:29:38,171
I need room
for my new storyline.

380
00:29:38,214 --> 00:29:42,091
It's not exactly a savage horde 
with 20 savages, is it?

381
00:29:42,135 --> 00:29:46,053
You get 20 additional
hosts, not 50.

382
00:29:46,097 --> 00:29:47,847
The board won't care about
a few extra line items.

383
00:29:47,891 --> 00:29:52,101
Has Ford even approved
the narrative yet?

384
00:29:52,145 --> 00:29:55,021
Oh, he hasn't weighed in
on a storyline in years.

385
00:29:55,064 --> 00:29:57,106
And if corporate does
want to cut costs,

386
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,025
our fearless leader's
old hosts

387
00:29:59,068 --> 00:30:01,235
aren't the only things
ready for the knacker's yard.

388
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,401
<i> Are you lost?</i>

389
00:30:44,656 --> 00:30:46,948
No.

390
00:30:46,991 --> 00:30:49,742
Just strayed a bit too far

391
00:30:49,786 --> 00:30:51,828
from where
I'm supposed to be.

392
00:30:51,871 --> 00:30:54,622
Same as you, I imagine.

393
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:57,208
We're on holiday.

394
00:30:57,252 --> 00:30:58,960
It's boring.

395
00:30:59,003 --> 00:31:01,254
Daddy said we could
do as we please.

396
00:31:01,297 --> 00:31:03,589
Ah, my father used to say

397
00:31:03,633 --> 00:31:05,258
that only boring people
get bored.

398
00:31:05,301 --> 00:31:07,134
Mine, too.

399
00:31:07,178 --> 00:31:09,595
I used to think
it's only boring people

400
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:11,097
who don't feel boredom,

401
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:14,851
<i> so cannot conceive</i>
<i> of it in others.</i>

402
00:31:14,894 --> 00:31:16,102
I'm taking a walk.

403
00:31:16,187 --> 00:31:18,813
You're welcome to join me
if you'd like.

404
00:31:28,658 --> 00:31:31,284
<i> Let's see a little</i>
<i> spring in your step.</i>

405
00:31:31,327 --> 00:31:32,952
<i> Not much further.</i>

406
00:31:32,996 --> 00:31:34,745
Go fuck yourself.

407
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:37,164
You have any idea who I am?

408
00:31:38,835 --> 00:31:41,043
I know exactly
who you are, Lawrence.

409
00:31:42,505 --> 00:31:43,838
After all,
you and I are friends.

410
00:31:43,882 --> 00:31:46,382
Which is why
I was so surprised

411
00:31:46,426 --> 00:31:48,801
when your friend Kissy
told me about this place.

412
00:31:50,722 --> 00:31:52,471
Where are we?

413
00:31:54,225 --> 00:31:55,850
Your home.

414
00:32:04,819 --> 00:32:07,653
No, no, no, no.

415
00:32:09,407 --> 00:32:11,657
You know, you and I hunted down

416
00:32:11,701 --> 00:32:14,493
Ghost Nation braves
in their winter grounds.

417
00:32:14,537 --> 00:32:16,704
<i> I know the whiskey</i>
<i> you like to drink.</i>

418
00:32:16,748 --> 00:32:20,291
I know the tune you whistle
when you're taking a piss.

419
00:32:23,421 --> 00:32:24,045
But...

420
00:32:26,716 --> 00:32:27,882
you never told me
you had a family.

421
00:32:32,847 --> 00:32:35,723
- Papa!
- Hey.

422
00:32:35,767 --> 00:32:38,935
That's what I love about this place...
all the secrets,

423
00:32:38,978 --> 00:32:42,897
all the little things
I never noticed

424
00:32:42,941 --> 00:32:45,733
<i> even after</i>
<i> all these years.</i>

425
00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:50,655
You know why this beats
the real world, Lawrence?

426
00:32:51,699 --> 00:32:54,450
Real world is just chaos.

427
00:32:54,494 --> 00:32:56,994
It's an accident.

428
00:32:58,373 --> 00:33:00,539
But in here, every detail

429
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:04,293
adds up to something.

430
00:33:04,337 --> 00:33:06,462
Even you, Lawrence.

431
00:33:06,506 --> 00:33:09,090
What do you want from me?

432
00:33:09,133 --> 00:33:11,217
The maze.

433
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,137
How do I find the entrance?

434
00:33:15,181 --> 00:33:17,306
I told you,

435
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:20,059
I don't know anything
about no fucking maze.

436
00:33:27,735 --> 00:33:29,235
Here you go, darlin'.

437
00:33:30,697 --> 00:33:34,115
And you get to decide what we're 
gonna do with them.

438
00:33:37,286 --> 00:33:39,161
Hell, it took you
long enough.

439
00:33:39,205 --> 00:33:41,789
<i> I was getting</i>
<i> the grand reserve.</i>

440
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:43,332
Only for our most
distinguished guests.

441
00:33:43,376 --> 00:33:45,084
Yeah, I'm sure it had nothing
to do with you

442
00:33:45,128 --> 00:33:47,878
telling this dipshit's cousins
to bring some more men.

443
00:33:56,139 --> 00:33:59,140
You got anything
to tell me, Lawrence?

444
00:34:02,103 --> 00:34:04,812
Then I guess we're gonna have 
to find a way to jog your memory.

445
00:34:09,652 --> 00:34:12,153
This guest already
took out an entire posse.

446
00:34:12,196 --> 00:34:13,237
Want me to slow him down?

447
00:34:13,281 --> 00:34:16,198
That gentleman gets
whatever he wants.

448
00:34:21,247 --> 00:34:23,622
I feel bad, my friend.

449
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:28,753
My cousins are usually
so hospitable.

450
00:34:28,796 --> 00:34:30,713
You don't understand,
Lawrence.

451
00:34:30,757 --> 00:34:33,049
I've been coming here
for 30 years.

452
00:34:33,092 --> 00:34:36,761
In a sense, I was...
I was born here.

453
00:34:37,847 --> 00:34:40,514
And this here, this...

454
00:34:42,477 --> 00:34:44,226
...this is exactly
why I come.

455
00:35:28,898 --> 00:35:30,189
Santa Maria,
<i> madre dios.</i>

456
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:41,075
All right. Well, as much fun 
as this is, I got to be moving on.

457
00:36:05,476 --> 00:36:08,060
Like I said,
you get to decide these two.

458
00:36:08,688 --> 00:36:11,939
What's it gonna be?

459
00:36:11,983 --> 00:36:14,233
Please, I don't know
how to find the maze.

460
00:36:17,029 --> 00:36:19,905
Time for a spin, darlin'.

461
00:36:31,127 --> 00:36:33,335
It's beautifully done, really.

462
00:36:35,214 --> 00:36:37,381
But you see the cracks
after a while.

463
00:36:37,425 --> 00:36:40,509
<i> That's why I like</i>
<i> the basic emotions.</i>

464
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,598
You know what that means?

465
00:36:45,641 --> 00:36:47,975
Please.

466
00:36:58,821 --> 00:37:01,322
It means when you're suffering,

467
00:37:01,365 --> 00:37:04,283
<i> that's when</i>
<i> you're most real.</i>

468
00:37:22,053 --> 00:37:25,346
The maze isn't meant for you.

469
00:37:26,724 --> 00:37:28,933
What'd I tell you, Lawrence?

470
00:37:28,976 --> 00:37:31,435
<i> Always another level.</i>

471
00:37:31,479 --> 00:37:34,271
I'll take my chances,
sweetheart.

472
00:37:34,315 --> 00:37:37,733
Follow the blood arroyo to the place 
where the snake lays its eggs.

473
00:37:40,321 --> 00:37:43,530
You have it now.
Whatever you want.

474
00:37:43,574 --> 00:37:47,201
Why don't you go home,
leave us alone?

475
00:37:49,205 --> 00:37:52,748
No, you don't
understand, Lawrence.

476
00:37:53,709 --> 00:37:57,419
This time,
I'm never going back.

477
00:38:17,275 --> 00:38:20,401
And we wanted to climb
to the top of the mountain,

478
00:38:20,444 --> 00:38:23,946
but Daddy said
we weren't allowed.

479
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:25,823
And then Tommy dared me.

480
00:38:29,287 --> 00:38:31,245
And here we are.

481
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:35,374
Nowhere land.

482
00:38:35,418 --> 00:38:39,169
That seems hardly a fitting name 
for a place so full.

483
00:38:39,213 --> 00:38:41,547
Can't you see it?

484
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,674
Perhaps you're not
looking hard enough.

485
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:46,760
<i> At what?</i>

486
00:38:46,804 --> 00:38:49,013
The town with
the white church.

487
00:38:50,558 --> 00:38:53,475
Listen.
Can't you hear its bell?

488
00:38:55,146 --> 00:38:57,229
Yes.

489
00:38:57,273 --> 00:38:58,480
Yes, I can hear it now.

490
00:38:58,524 --> 00:39:00,816
Yeah.

491
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,735
I thought you might.

492
00:39:02,778 --> 00:39:05,779
You see what a bored mind
can conjure?

493
00:39:19,962 --> 00:39:23,130
How did you do that?

494
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:27,926
<i>Is it magic?</i>

495
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:30,095
Everything in this world
is magic,

496
00:39:30,139 --> 00:39:32,890
except to the magician.

497
00:39:41,942 --> 00:39:44,568
Best you head home now.

498
00:39:44,612 --> 00:39:46,320
But Tommy's not
going to believe...

499
00:39:46,364 --> 00:39:48,447
You're not going to come
back here again, are you?

500
00:39:54,705 --> 00:39:56,497
No.

501
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,331
Run along, now.

502
00:40:49,552 --> 00:40:51,927
You weren't at your office.

503
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:54,555
You seem to have
found me anyway.

504
00:40:56,642 --> 00:40:58,934
- Listen, earlier...
- Forget it.

505
00:41:28,966 --> 00:41:30,924
Stay a little longer.
We can talk.

506
00:41:30,968 --> 00:41:33,177
We never talk.

507
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:36,180
- I'm serious.
<i>- So am I.</i>

508
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:43,228
You're certainly a man comfortable 
with long, pensive silences.

509
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,733
Although, ironically,

510
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:50,277
your creations
never shut up.

511
00:41:50,321 --> 00:41:53,739
They're always talking
to each other,

512
00:41:53,782 --> 00:41:56,241
even when there are
no guests around.

513
00:41:56,285 --> 00:41:58,577
They're always trying
to error correct.

514
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:03,540
Make themselves more human.

515
00:42:03,584 --> 00:42:05,626
When they talk to each other,
it's a way of practicing.

516
00:42:05,669 --> 00:42:09,630
Is that what you're doing now?

517
00:42:09,673 --> 00:42:11,048
Practicing?

518
00:42:21,769 --> 00:42:23,977
QA told us she was
being decommissioned.

519
00:42:24,021 --> 00:42:25,229
- Do you work for QA?
- No, but...

520
00:42:25,272 --> 00:42:27,523
Run a fast-pass diagnostic.

521
00:42:31,111 --> 00:42:34,404
All righty.

522
00:42:35,324 --> 00:42:39,785
Some non-affect hesitation.

523
00:42:39,828 --> 00:42:42,913
Little cognitive D.

524
00:42:42,957 --> 00:42:43,914
And a fuckload of aggression,

525
00:42:43,958 --> 00:42:47,417
courtesy of those morons
in narrative.

526
00:42:47,461 --> 00:42:51,088
You don't need
to be aggro, do you?

527
00:42:51,131 --> 00:42:54,299
Just a quicker study of those 
repressed fucks walking through the door.

528
00:42:54,343 --> 00:42:56,468
Archive this configuration.

529
00:42:56,512 --> 00:42:59,596
Open up her primaries.

530
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,849
Perception.
Emotional acuity.

531
00:43:02,893 --> 00:43:04,810
Bump it.

532
00:43:04,853 --> 00:43:07,896
1.5%.

533
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,898
<i>- Updating.</i>
- Okay.

534
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:14,069
<i>- Do they dream?</i>
- What?

535
00:43:14,113 --> 00:43:16,572
In her story,
she said she dreamed.

536
00:43:16,615 --> 00:43:17,531
Do we make them dream?

537
00:43:17,575 --> 00:43:20,284
Fuck would be
the point of that?

538
00:43:20,327 --> 00:43:23,453
Dreams are mainly memories.

539
00:43:23,497 --> 00:43:25,664
Can you imagine how fucked
we'd be if these poor assholes

540
00:43:25,708 --> 00:43:28,834
ever remembered what
the guests do to them?

541
00:43:28,877 --> 00:43:32,796
We do give them
the concept of dreams.

542
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,840
Specifically nightmares.

543
00:43:34,883 --> 00:43:37,217
<i> Why?</i>

544
00:43:37,261 --> 00:43:40,178
Just in case somebody forgets to wipe them 
out at the end of a maintenance session.

545
00:43:40,222 --> 00:43:42,097
If she's got any dreams, 
it's just of those sloppy fucks

546
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:45,559
down in the body shop patching 
her back together again.

547
00:43:47,062 --> 00:43:49,146
She's got some
physical discomfort.

548
00:43:49,189 --> 00:43:52,983
Put in a request for a full physical
at her next rotation.

549
00:43:55,321 --> 00:43:56,737
All right, gorgeous,

550
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:59,031
<i> you're back to the races.</i>

551
00:43:59,074 --> 00:44:03,243
<i> You're gonna wake</i>
<i> in three, two, one.</i>

552
00:44:03,287 --> 00:44:07,581
So I ran away,
crossed the shining sea.

553
00:44:07,625 --> 00:44:10,417
And when I finally set foot
back on solid ground,

554
00:44:10,461 --> 00:44:13,670
the first thing I heard
was that voice.

555
00:44:13,714 --> 00:44:15,422
Do you know what it said?

556
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,216
It said...

557
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:21,720
this is the new world.

558
00:44:23,557 --> 00:44:25,766
And in this world...

559
00:44:27,353 --> 00:44:30,979
You can be whoever
the fuck you want.

560
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:51,041
Well, he seemed convinced.

561
00:44:53,712 --> 00:44:56,672
You know the first voice I heard 
when I got off that boat?

562
00:44:56,715 --> 00:44:59,049
A nice young man
from Baton Rouge

563
00:44:59,093 --> 00:45:02,803
said my pussy could earn him
two whole dollars a day.

564
00:45:02,846 --> 00:45:05,806
And he'd be more than happy
to let me have up to 30%.

565
00:45:05,849 --> 00:45:09,810
Well, then I guess you could 
add lying to your list of sins.

566
00:45:09,853 --> 00:45:12,604
The only thing wrong
with the seven deadly sins

567
00:45:12,648 --> 00:45:14,731
is that there aren't
more of them.

568
00:45:14,775 --> 00:45:16,316
And while we're
on the subject,

569
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,694
my transgressions wash off
a little easier than yours.

570
00:45:21,281 --> 00:45:22,739
At least when my girls
are done with a man,

571
00:45:22,783 --> 00:45:25,742
he's still left
drawing breath.

572
00:45:25,786 --> 00:45:27,411
For the most part.

573
00:45:27,454 --> 00:45:29,162
<i> Get the fuck away</i>
<i> from my table.</i>

574
00:45:29,206 --> 00:45:31,998
<i> Hey, fuck you!</i>

575
00:45:32,042 --> 00:45:33,667
Well, in that case...

576
00:45:35,879 --> 00:45:37,087
...here's to our indiscretions.

577
00:45:37,131 --> 00:45:38,880
<i> ...fucking bullshit</i>
<i> for one night.</i>

578
00:45:38,924 --> 00:45:40,882
<i> I'll shoot everyone</i>
<i> in this dump...</i>

579
00:45:40,926 --> 00:45:42,676
Spoken and otherwise.

580
00:46:00,237 --> 00:46:03,113
Now that's a fucking vacation!

581
00:49:13,388 --> 00:49:15,180
Three,

582
00:49:15,223 --> 00:49:19,100
two,

583
00:49:19,144 --> 00:49:21,061
one.

584
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:37,535
<i> Found it.</i>

585
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:41,122
<i> It's MRSA in her abdomen.</i>

586
00:49:41,166 --> 00:49:43,708
Filthy fucking animals
not cleaning up.

587
00:49:43,752 --> 00:49:45,043
No wonder we have
a fucking fly problem.

588
00:49:45,087 --> 00:49:49,214
Don't look at me.
I'm the king of hygiene.

589
00:49:49,925 --> 00:49:52,884
Bullshit.
I've seen you.

590
00:49:52,928 --> 00:49:54,886
<i> You just glop that shit on</i>
<i> and rinse.</i>

591
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:57,639
<i> You understand,</i>
<i> soap is mechanical.</i>

592
00:49:57,683 --> 00:50:00,100
<i>- Fuck are you talking about?</i>
<i>- Bubbles.</i>

593
00:50:00,143 --> 00:50:02,727
If you're not making the little bubbles,
you're not doing shit.

594
00:50:02,771 --> 00:50:04,312
Fuck! Fuck!
What the fuck?!

595
00:50:04,356 --> 00:50:05,939
- Shit!
- What the fuck?

598
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:15,865
No. Oh, fuck.

600
00:50:18,704 --> 00:50:22,038
Asshole, you forgot
to put her in sleep mode.

601
00:50:23,834 --> 00:50:26,001
- Oh!
- Don't, don't, don't!

602
00:50:26,044 --> 00:50:27,627
No! No, no, no!

603
00:50:27,671 --> 00:50:30,213
- Don't! Don't, don't, don't, don't.

604
00:50:30,257 --> 00:50:32,924
Stop. Put that down!

605
00:50:32,968 --> 00:50:35,385
You break anything in her head, 
we have to file a damage report.

606
00:50:35,429 --> 00:50:37,721
Uh, okay, let's talk to her.

607
00:50:37,764 --> 00:50:39,681
- What's her name?
- Maeve!

608
00:50:39,725 --> 00:50:40,890
Hi, Maeve.
Maeve, hi.

609
00:50:40,934 --> 00:50:44,561
Look, uh, you gotta calm down.

610
00:50:44,604 --> 00:50:46,980
Okay? Let's sit down
and we can help you.

611
00:50:47,024 --> 00:50:49,357
Keep your fucking hands off me.

612
00:50:52,154 --> 00:50:53,737
No.

613
00:52:30,585 --> 00:52:31,626
I swear I put it
in sleep mode.

614
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:34,379
Oh, does this look
like fucking sleep mode?

615
00:52:36,299 --> 00:52:38,716
Calm the fuck down and
help me move this... thing

616
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,761
before someone sees.

617
00:53:07,622 --> 00:53:09,080
Here?

618
00:53:39,362 --> 00:53:42,280
This storyline will make
Hieronymus Bosch

619
00:53:42,324 --> 00:53:44,532
look like he was
doodling kittens.

620
00:53:44,576 --> 00:53:48,703
I have vivisection,
self-cannibalism,

621
00:53:48,747 --> 00:53:53,082
a special little something
I call the "whoroborus."

622
00:53:53,126 --> 00:53:55,752
Now, I don't want
to appear immodest,

623
00:53:55,795 --> 00:54:01,507
but this is the apex of
what the park could provide...

624
00:54:01,551 --> 00:54:03,218
<i>- horror...</i>
- Miss anything interesting?

625
00:54:03,261 --> 00:54:06,137
<i> ...romance,</i>
<i> titillation.</i>

626
00:54:06,181 --> 00:54:08,348
Lee not appearing immodest.

627
00:54:08,391 --> 00:54:10,642
Our most skilled guests
will fight their ways

628
00:54:10,685 --> 00:54:12,518
to the outer limits
of the park,

629
00:54:12,562 --> 00:54:16,231
besting fearsome braves,
seducing nubile maidens,

630
00:54:16,274 --> 00:54:19,817
befriending tragically
ill-fated sidekicks,

631
00:54:19,861 --> 00:54:22,737
and, of course,

632
00:54:22,781 --> 00:54:25,031
like all our best narratives
over the years,

633
00:54:25,075 --> 00:54:27,825
our guests will have
the privilege

634
00:54:27,869 --> 00:54:30,745
<i> of getting to know the character</i>
<i> they're most interested in...</i>

635
00:54:30,789 --> 00:54:32,747
themselves.

636
00:54:32,791 --> 00:54:37,001
I present our guests'
next obsession:

637
00:54:37,087 --> 00:54:40,296
Odyssey on Red River.

638
00:54:51,017 --> 00:54:52,267
No.

639
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:53,017
Sorry?

640
00:54:53,061 --> 00:54:56,854
No, I don't think so.

641
00:54:56,898 --> 00:54:58,439
<i> Wait, you don't think...</i>

642
00:54:58,483 --> 00:55:00,066
-i> What is the point of it?</i>

643
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:03,069
Get a couple
of cheap thrills?

644
00:55:03,113 --> 00:55:04,946
Some surprises?

645
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:06,823
But it's not enough.

646
00:55:06,866 --> 00:55:10,326
It's not about giving the guests
what you think they want.

647
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:11,327
No, that's simple.

648
00:55:11,371 --> 00:55:15,999
The titillation,
horror, elation...

649
00:55:16,042 --> 00:55:17,792
They're parlor tricks.

650
00:55:17,836 --> 00:55:23,339
The guests don't return
for the obvious things we do,

651
00:55:23,383 --> 00:55:25,425
the garish things.

652
00:55:27,095 --> 00:55:32,265
They come back
because of the subtleties,

653
00:55:32,309 --> 00:55:33,308
the details.

654
00:55:35,437 --> 00:55:38,771
<i> They come back</i>
<i> because they discover</i>

655
00:55:38,815 --> 00:55:43,651
<i> something they imagine no one</i>
<i> had ever noticed before...</i>

656
00:55:47,824 --> 00:55:49,407
<i> something they've</i>
<i> fallen in love with.</i>

657
00:55:52,954 --> 00:55:54,454
<i> They're not looking</i>
<i> for a story</i>

658
00:55:54,497 --> 00:55:58,041
that tells them who they are.

659
00:55:58,084 --> 00:56:00,877
They already know
who they are.

660
00:56:07,344 --> 00:56:10,261
They're here because
they want a glimpse

661
00:56:10,305 --> 00:56:11,679
of who they could be.

662
00:56:11,723 --> 00:56:14,640
<i> Billy!</i>

663
00:56:14,684 --> 00:56:16,392
Let's go.

664
00:56:21,775 --> 00:56:24,734
<i> The only thing</i>
<i> your story tells me,</i>

665
00:56:24,778 --> 00:56:29,489
Mr. Sizemore, is who you are.

666
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:38,039
Well, isn't there anything
you like about it?

667
00:56:42,212 --> 00:56:44,337
What size are those boots?

668
00:56:51,346 --> 00:56:53,221
Something you want
to say, Mr. Lowe?

669
00:56:53,264 --> 00:56:57,100
- The board, sir.
- Yeah?

670
00:56:57,143 --> 00:56:59,560
This might ruffle
some feathers.

671
00:56:59,604 --> 00:57:01,062
You promised them
a new storyline.

672
00:57:01,106 --> 00:57:03,940
They shall have one.

673
00:57:03,983 --> 00:57:07,193
Something I've been
working on for some time.

674
00:57:10,448 --> 00:57:12,490
Something quite original.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
