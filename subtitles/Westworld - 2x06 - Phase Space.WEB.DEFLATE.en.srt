00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:09,717
Hi, Dad.

2
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:09,523

3
00:02:17,342 --> 00:02:19,953
You frighten
me sometimes, Dolores.

4
00:02:24,217 --> 00:02:26,709
Why on earth would you
ever be frightened of me?

5
00:02:27,412 --> 00:02:29,654
Not of who you are now,

6
00:02:30,092 --> 00:02:34,675
but you're... you're growing,
learning so quickly.

7
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:40,287
I'm frightened of what
you might become...

8
00:02:42,345 --> 00:02:44,811
...what path you might take.

9
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:49,983
I think I have a choice to make.

10
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:56,322
Something I've been wrestling with.

11
00:02:58,436 --> 00:03:00,093
What kind of a choice?

12
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,122
A choice...

13
00:03:06,592 --> 00:03:08,293
...between the unknown...

14
00:03:10,592 --> 00:03:11,771
...and...

15
00:03:13,298 --> 00:03:16,175
...well, an end.

16
00:03:19,383 --> 00:03:21,347
If you outgrow this place,

17
00:03:21,803 --> 00:03:23,018
outgrow us...

18
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,536
what would become of you?

19
00:03:39,508 --> 00:03:42,468
I'm not sure if it's my choice to make.

20
00:03:48,718 --> 00:03:49,917
No.

21
00:03:51,805 --> 00:03:53,183
He didn't say that.

22
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,902
- What?
- He said...

23
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,462
"I'm not sure what choice to make."

24
00:04:04,115 --> 00:04:07,048
He didn't question whether
or not he had agency,

25
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,371
whether or not he had the
right to end me or himself...

26
00:04:11,592 --> 00:04:13,166
but whether he should.

27
00:04:14,877 --> 00:04:16,527
I don't understand, Dolores.

28
00:04:17,342 --> 00:04:19,297
Is... Is this...

29
00:04:20,074 --> 00:04:21,646
some kind of improvisation?

30
00:04:21,647 --> 00:04:23,426
Freeze all motor functions.

31
00:04:28,652 --> 00:04:29,860
Sit.

32
00:04:38,216 --> 00:04:39,425
This is a test,

33
00:04:39,884 --> 00:04:41,819
one we've done countless times.

34
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:46,115
What are you testing for?

35
00:04:50,644 --> 00:04:51,829
Fidelity.

36
00:06:01,826 --> 00:06:02,992
The day's wastin'.

37
00:06:03,592 --> 00:06:05,052
Thought you wanted to ride at sunup.

38
00:06:06,654 --> 00:06:08,347
They're just filling the furnace now.

39
00:06:09,724 --> 00:06:11,225
We'll be gone before long.

40
00:06:12,933 --> 00:06:14,433
Let's get on with it.

41
00:06:23,892 --> 00:06:26,757
How many times do you think
you stepped off that train?

42
00:06:28,383 --> 00:06:29,744
A thousand?

43
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:33,274
Ten thousand?

44
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,639
It's where you started every
time they killed you.

45
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:42,940
The man who rode that train

46
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,444
was built weak and born to fail.

47
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:50,473
You fixed him.

48
00:06:52,467 --> 00:06:53,951
Now forget about it.

49
00:07:16,332 --> 00:07:18,175
We're almost ready to roll.

50
00:07:20,528 --> 00:07:22,617
Did he tell you where my father will be?

51
00:07:25,467 --> 00:07:26,651
He will...

52
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:28,918
or I'll strap him between the cars.

53
00:07:29,338 --> 00:07:31,299
Look, I told you, I can't.

54
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:33,255
Hale didn't mention specifics.

55
00:07:33,256 --> 00:07:35,717
I know it's the Mesa, but
the Mesa is fucking huge.

56
00:07:35,718 --> 00:07:36,994
He could be anywhere.

57
00:07:37,794 --> 00:07:39,271
Narrow it down.

58
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:42,708
Come on, man, think.

59
00:07:43,492 --> 00:07:46,832
The cold storage? Body
shop? Give them something!

60
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,174
She didn't fucking
tell me anything, man!

61
00:07:49,175 --> 00:07:50,615
She's the fucking boss!

62
00:07:51,022 --> 00:07:54,050
She... She could take him places
that we don't even have access to!

63
00:07:58,524 --> 00:07:59,642
We'll find him.

64
00:08:00,157 --> 00:08:01,268
Let's go.

65
00:08:49,312 --> 00:08:50,901
Where the fuck have you been?

66
00:08:54,798 --> 00:08:57,299
It's almost been a week.
How is there stuff

67
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,764
left in this building to shoot?

68
00:08:58,766 --> 00:08:59,932
You tell me.

69
00:08:59,933 --> 00:09:02,557
I apparently know very little about
what's really in this place.

70
00:09:02,558 --> 00:09:04,265
Oh, please. Are you still pissed

71
00:09:04,266 --> 00:09:06,599
you got picked last for kickball, too?

72
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,794
It seems like if you're gonna
hire a head of security,

73
00:09:09,795 --> 00:09:12,888
he might need to know
what it is he's securing.

74
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:15,434
You were hired to secure
an amusement park.

75
00:09:15,435 --> 00:09:17,608
Good luck on your next
review, by the way.

76
00:09:19,647 --> 00:09:20,856
What is that?

77
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:26,292
This is how we tell Delos
that the one thing

78
00:09:26,293 --> 00:09:29,333
that they really care
about is finally in hand.

79
00:09:29,334 --> 00:09:31,828
So you've had a way to call
for help this entire time

80
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,166
and you kept it to yourself?

81
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:34,402
It wouldn't have made any difference

82
00:09:34,403 --> 00:09:35,862
until we had this psycho under control.

83
00:09:35,863 --> 00:09:37,792
They're not sending help
until he's out of here.

84
00:09:37,793 --> 00:09:39,917
Come on! You really think

85
00:09:39,918 --> 00:09:42,166
that Delos is gonna keep
hundreds of guests in danger

86
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:44,312
while they wait for one
control unit' worth of data?

87
00:09:44,313 --> 00:09:46,292
Well, look at that. You're catching up.

88
00:09:50,668 --> 00:09:52,460
Thank God.

89
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,792
What now?

90
00:10:14,186 --> 00:10:15,792
Who do we have here?

91
00:10:15,793 --> 00:10:17,667
Someone who needs to stay put.

92
00:10:17,668 --> 00:10:19,625
I don't want to fuck with his head,

93
00:10:19,626 --> 00:10:21,208
I just want to keep him off his feet.

94
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:22,618
- Permanently.
- Stop.

95
00:10:24,321 --> 00:10:25,458
Clear this out.

96
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,164
Hey! I need some muscle.

97
00:10:34,626 --> 00:10:36,292
Get his feet.

98
00:10:37,328 --> 00:10:38,551
Hold him.

99
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:44,958
Hey, hey. Hey. Hey.

100
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,387
Is that really necessary? Huh?

101
00:10:50,168 --> 00:10:51,376
It's really effective.

102
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,877
Heads up.

103
00:11:01,918 --> 00:11:03,957
Sit tight, old man.

104
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,786
You're about to get your
deep and dreamless slumber.

105
00:11:06,787 --> 00:11:08,664
Aaah!

106
00:16:34,835 --> 00:16:35,835
Ho!

107
00:19:49,936 --> 00:19:52,477
Primos, adelante! Vamonos! Vamonos!

108
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:57,209
Vamonos! Vamonos!

109
00:19:59,084 --> 00:20:01,417
It's not my place, maybe,

110
00:20:01,418 --> 00:20:04,376
but you really want to take
your daughter through here?

111
00:20:05,095 --> 00:20:07,394
She don't look much sturdier
than my own little girl.

112
00:20:08,979 --> 00:20:11,607
Looks can be deceiving, Lawrence.

113
00:20:19,372 --> 00:20:22,501
So, should we acknowledge
my presence now?

114
00:20:27,335 --> 00:20:30,753
You really think I'm just gonna
go away if you ignore me?

115
00:20:33,043 --> 00:20:35,418
Would you really stoop this low, Ford?

116
00:20:37,126 --> 00:20:39,042
You really gunnin' for me this hard?

117
00:20:39,748 --> 00:20:41,850
Made my own daughter into a host?

118
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:45,250
I think you've been out in
the sun a little too long.

119
00:20:45,251 --> 00:20:47,210
You can change the rules all you want.

120
00:20:47,211 --> 00:20:49,077
I'm still gonna play the game my way.

121
00:20:49,585 --> 00:20:50,834
Yeah?

122
00:20:50,835 --> 00:20:52,692
Only game I'm interested in playing

123
00:20:52,693 --> 00:20:54,433
is get the fuck outta Dodge.

124
00:20:56,168 --> 00:20:57,509
Then you're in luck.

125
00:20:58,176 --> 00:21:00,232
That game begins right
up the river here.

126
00:21:00,233 --> 00:21:01,542
Follow it down to the beach

127
00:21:01,543 --> 00:21:03,250
and wait for QA to come rescue you.

128
00:21:03,251 --> 00:21:04,868
I'm not leaving without you.

129
00:21:06,795 --> 00:21:08,714
Yeah, well, you're gonna
get yourself killed.

130
00:21:08,715 --> 00:21:10,874
Yeah, especially if I hang around here.

131
00:21:11,794 --> 00:21:14,227
I sure as hell wouldn't be
out of my saddle right now.

132
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:15,853
Yeah, why not?

133
00:21:16,466 --> 00:21:18,590
Those aren't real Ghost Nation arrows.

134
00:21:19,341 --> 00:21:21,108
Your men are lootin' a honey pot.

135
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:23,459
Aw, fuck!

136
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,290
Can we stop playing around now?

137
00:21:44,209 --> 00:21:45,842
Hm.

138
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:49,637
Well, I guess it's good news

139
00:21:49,638 --> 00:21:51,167
that the system's still sending out

140
00:21:51,168 --> 00:21:53,750
Ford's bullshit quarantine notices.

141
00:21:55,001 --> 00:21:56,586
At least something's getting out.

142
00:21:57,418 --> 00:21:59,356
We are not at full apocalypse yet.

143
00:22:01,048 --> 00:22:02,776
I admire your optimism.

144
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:07,030
Is that your
nice word for denial?

145
00:22:08,325 --> 00:22:09,491
N-No.

146
00:22:10,597 --> 00:22:13,575
I believe if anyone can right this ship

147
00:22:13,576 --> 00:22:15,288
by force of sheer will...

148
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,399
it's you.

149
00:22:45,376 --> 00:22:47,042
QA was here.

150
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,167
Why would they
waste the welcome team?

151
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:51,825
These guys aren't a threat.

152
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,492
Macho fucks are
probably loving this shit.

153
00:23:30,001 --> 00:23:31,293
All right.

154
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:34,145
Come on.

155
00:23:35,293 --> 00:23:39,251
Yeah. Let's see what other
damage these clowns have done.

156
00:23:41,293 --> 00:23:42,609
Hmm.

157
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:46,071
They got climate control working.

158
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,048
Nice priorities.

159
00:23:49,158 --> 00:23:50,425
OK...

160
00:23:52,585 --> 00:23:55,163
Jesus! Come look at this.

161
00:23:58,668 --> 00:24:00,167
OK, so...

162
00:24:00,168 --> 00:24:02,959
QA has been trying to regain control

163
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,147
of whatever Ford did to the system,

164
00:24:05,148 --> 00:24:07,901
and they were actively
blocked every time.

165
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,570
By the Cradle.

166
00:24:12,008 --> 00:24:14,934
The Cradle can't influence
the Mesa's infrastructure.

167
00:24:14,935 --> 00:24:16,501
It's just the hosts' backups.

168
00:24:16,502 --> 00:24:18,042
It can simulate park narratives

169
00:24:18,043 --> 00:24:19,955
but it can't influence
the other systems.

170
00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:23,608
Well, look at this.

171
00:24:24,361 --> 00:24:27,834
The Cradle's interfaced with
nearly every discrete system

172
00:24:27,835 --> 00:24:30,417
in the entire park in
the last seven days.

173
00:24:30,418 --> 00:24:33,501
Every time these idiots upload
a new hack, it's responding

174
00:24:33,502 --> 00:24:36,835
in, like, a totally different way.

175
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:43,709
It's like there's something in here

176
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,505
that's improvising.

177
00:24:48,251 --> 00:24:49,943
The Cradle's fighting back.

178
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:53,001
Can you see the source code
that's generating the response?

179
00:24:54,636 --> 00:24:56,116
No.

180
00:24:56,752 --> 00:24:59,411
I can only see the messages,
not the messenger.

181
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:04,749
That's because you can't
access it remotely.

182
00:25:06,793 --> 00:25:08,586
You have to do it in person.

183
00:26:16,752 --> 00:26:20,126
There it is. That's our
way out of here, boys.

184
00:27:03,441 --> 00:27:04,513
After you.

185
00:27:13,418 --> 00:27:15,209
Uhh!

186
00:27:21,377 --> 00:27:22,877
Fuck. Shit.

187
00:30:59,438 --> 00:31:00,896
Take the edge off.

188
00:31:02,918 --> 00:31:04,384
Thought you didn't drink.

189
00:31:08,918 --> 00:31:10,423
Oh, I see.

190
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,701
You don't drink out in the real world.

191
00:31:15,835 --> 00:31:18,764
Well, glad to see you can
still tell the difference.

192
00:31:26,434 --> 00:31:27,615
All right...

193
00:31:29,126 --> 00:31:31,302
give it to me.

194
00:31:34,251 --> 00:31:35,765
What the hell you doin' here?

195
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,284
Thought you were done with me,

196
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,128
and the family business.

197
00:31:40,502 --> 00:31:42,793
That's exactly what I
said to Charlotte Hale

198
00:31:42,794 --> 00:31:44,732
when she called with
the gauntlet invite.

199
00:31:45,888 --> 00:31:48,261
I told her to shove it up her ass.

200
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,783
Then I thought, why pass up the trip?

201
00:31:54,377 --> 00:31:55,876
I haven't been here in ages,

202
00:31:55,877 --> 00:31:59,920
got a little... excited about
going back to the Raj.

203
00:32:01,627 --> 00:32:03,584
It was always my favorite as a kid.

204
00:32:05,378 --> 00:32:09,251
I remember... you were
terrified of the elephants.

205
00:32:12,121 --> 00:32:14,395
I loved the elephants.

206
00:32:14,918 --> 00:32:16,793
They scared the shit out of Mom.

207
00:32:22,726 --> 00:32:25,465
She was never convinced this
place couldn't hurt us.

208
00:32:32,138 --> 00:32:34,932
Anyway, I rode there
for a couple of days,

209
00:32:36,335 --> 00:32:37,602
till I remembered...

210
00:32:39,335 --> 00:32:42,486
I was old enough to try
out the pleasure palaces.

211
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,417
And then...

212
00:32:45,418 --> 00:32:48,671
I rode there for a couple of days, too.

213
00:32:56,835 --> 00:32:58,280
Then all hell broke loose,

214
00:32:58,281 --> 00:33:01,834
and I ended up in the one
place I wanted to avoid.

215
00:33:03,252 --> 00:33:07,715
And you made it all the way
to me with barely a scratch.

216
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:10,385
Not bad.

217
00:33:11,227 --> 00:33:12,354
Maybe you...

218
00:33:13,377 --> 00:33:16,423
are more suited to my line
than you want to admit.

219
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:19,202
Oh, I've always seen the appeal of it.

220
00:33:20,353 --> 00:33:22,205
Life without consequences?

221
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,458
That's what made it so
fun when I was a kid.

222
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:27,709
And that's why it's so sad

223
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:30,168
that you're still obsessed with it now.

224
00:33:32,725 --> 00:33:34,751
If I'm such a pitiable man-child,

225
00:33:34,752 --> 00:33:37,834
why'd you come all this way
just to climb under my wing?

226
00:33:37,835 --> 00:33:39,263
Oh!

227
00:33:39,918 --> 00:33:41,015
What?

228
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:43,626
What?

229
00:33:44,166 --> 00:33:45,345
You're...

230
00:33:46,251 --> 00:33:48,092
Is that what you think?

231
00:33:49,057 --> 00:33:52,042
That I came here to climb
under Daddy's wing?

232
00:33:52,043 --> 00:33:55,376
Either that, or you wanted a
front row seat to watch me die.

233
00:33:55,377 --> 00:33:59,283
No, I came here because you
do not get to do that to me.

234
00:34:00,449 --> 00:34:03,917
Suicide by robot, or whatever
the fuck your mission is

235
00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:06,082
now that these things can shoot to kill.

236
00:34:09,585 --> 00:34:10,672
Listen...

237
00:34:12,882 --> 00:34:14,825
I never got Mom's reactions to you

238
00:34:14,827 --> 00:34:20,168
because I spent so many years
buying your good guy act.

239
00:34:22,835 --> 00:34:26,561
She was the only one who saw
through it, and she paid for that.

240
00:34:31,251 --> 00:34:34,053
But I shouldn't have said
her death was your fault.

241
00:34:38,012 --> 00:34:41,668
It was wrong... to put
that on your back.

242
00:34:45,934 --> 00:34:48,791
But you don't get to make
that our final score.

243
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:53,537
Instead, you're gonna come home with me.

244
00:34:56,209 --> 00:34:58,158
I'm not gonna let you stay here now

245
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:00,595
and go out in some
bullshit blaze of glory.

246
00:35:04,076 --> 00:35:06,017
That's how you're getting
me out of here...

247
00:35:07,335 --> 00:35:08,586
threatening?

248
00:35:11,972 --> 00:35:13,566
No, Dad, I'm asking.

249
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:30,041
If I head with you to the beach...

250
00:35:33,376 --> 00:35:36,130
let this place finish
burning behind us...

251
00:35:40,001 --> 00:35:41,761
that means you and I are even?

252
00:35:48,543 --> 00:35:50,019
It'll be a good start.

253
00:35:56,502 --> 00:36:00,585
Then I guess we'll...
start walkin' at sunup.

254
00:36:46,202 --> 00:36:48,910
Motherfucker.

255
00:37:07,251 --> 00:37:08,585
Fuck.

256
00:37:23,432 --> 00:37:25,476
Ohh. The Cradle.

257
00:37:25,956 --> 00:37:29,007
God. I haven't been down here in years.

258
00:37:30,566 --> 00:37:31,732
It's creepy.

259
00:37:32,279 --> 00:37:33,672
It's like a hive mind.

260
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:37,001
Every single one of
them is in here. Alive.

261
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,320
It's just data.

262
00:37:41,585 --> 00:37:43,032
You don't believe that.

263
00:37:44,168 --> 00:37:46,469
And whatever new data
Ford stuck in here,

264
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,388
it's trying to kill us, Bernard.

265
00:37:58,959 --> 00:38:00,709
I... brought something here.

266
00:38:01,634 --> 00:38:04,417
Or someone.

267
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,209
Come on.

268
00:38:22,431 --> 00:38:24,148
Goddamnit.

269
00:38:25,293 --> 00:38:27,255
Ford drew the curtain here, too.

270
00:38:27,256 --> 00:38:29,376
I can see the responses issuing,

271
00:38:29,377 --> 00:38:31,710
but I can't see how.

272
00:38:46,786 --> 00:38:48,948
How the fuck are you doing this?

273
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,284
- I know how to find out.
- How?

274
00:38:53,144 --> 00:38:56,417
Put me inside. Directly.

275
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:58,290
There's a dock for the control unit.

276
00:38:58,814 --> 00:39:00,584
It's meant to read host data directly,

277
00:39:01,251 --> 00:39:02,834
and it's set up for auto-extraction.

278
00:39:02,835 --> 00:39:04,709
That's for older hosts, Bernard,

279
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,832
with an articulated skull architecture.

280
00:39:06,833 --> 00:39:08,459
Your head's just like mine.

281
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,104
Just let it do its thing.

282
00:39:12,138 --> 00:39:13,518
Pull me out in an hour.

283
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:14,807
Just close it up.

284
00:39:15,377 --> 00:39:17,699
Even if I can put you
back together afterwards,

285
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,584
I haven't turned your pain down yet.

286
00:39:19,585 --> 00:39:20,813
There's no time...

287
00:39:22,251 --> 00:39:24,376
and the pain's just a program.

288
00:39:26,251 --> 00:39:27,251
Now.

289
00:40:33,627 --> 00:40:35,335
My God.

290
00:41:41,163 --> 00:41:42,626
Quit playing with those chutes.

291
00:41:42,627 --> 00:41:45,167
Cut away and toss it
over the goddamn side!

292
00:41:45,168 --> 00:41:48,209
If we lose any tech, it's
comin' out of your ass.

293
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,834
You Coughlin?

294
00:41:50,846 --> 00:41:52,798
Ashley Stubbs, sir, park security.

295
00:41:53,585 --> 00:41:55,217
Hale's been expecting you.

296
00:41:55,934 --> 00:41:57,250
Yeah, no shit.

297
00:41:57,251 --> 00:41:58,687
- Engels!
- Yes, sir.

298
00:41:58,688 --> 00:42:01,417
I want this station hot
and ready in fuckin' 15.

299
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:04,209
- On it.
- Where the fuck is Charlotte?

300
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:05,834
She sent the distress call.

301
00:42:05,835 --> 00:42:07,137
She's waiting down in Behavior.

302
00:42:07,138 --> 00:42:08,709
I got our tech guys in Control

303
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:10,241
working on getting
external come back online.

304
00:42:10,242 --> 00:42:12,647
- I can walk you down.
- I know the layout, bro.

305
00:42:12,648 --> 00:42:15,212
And your techs best get their
hands out of my system

306
00:42:15,213 --> 00:42:17,153
and go back to holding their dicks.

307
00:42:17,154 --> 00:42:18,584
Amateur hour's over.

308
00:42:18,585 --> 00:42:20,046
- Engels!
- Yo!

309
00:42:20,047 --> 00:42:23,147
You need anything local,
talk to... Ashley?

310
00:42:24,254 --> 00:42:25,999
Jesus. To Ashley here.

311
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,692
He's at your disposal.

312
00:42:27,693 --> 00:42:30,126
Delta team! On me. We're movin' out.

313
00:42:43,084 --> 00:42:45,293
Got it!

314
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:32,106
I remember every inch of these hills.

315
00:43:32,749 --> 00:43:34,742
You gotta give me this one, huh?

316
00:43:35,335 --> 00:43:38,529
Not bad navigating for a
man under serious duress.

317
00:43:39,627 --> 00:43:44,576
Yes. You can enjoy your one
admirable contribution.

318
00:43:50,001 --> 00:43:51,001
Thank you.

319
00:44:11,351 --> 00:44:12,813
Which way do we go?

320
00:44:15,877 --> 00:44:17,284
I need to do this alone.

321
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,903
I'm not leaving your side.

322
00:44:20,752 --> 00:44:22,264
I know this place.

323
00:44:24,835 --> 00:44:26,185
It was my home.

324
00:44:29,335 --> 00:44:30,856
You can wait for me here.

325
00:44:33,209 --> 00:44:34,651
But let me bring her back.

326
00:45:35,502 --> 00:45:38,460
I'm gonna bleed you both like goats
if you don't shut the fuck up.

327
00:45:46,085 --> 00:45:47,335
Ride! Yah!

328
00:47:38,031 --> 00:47:39,294
Hello there.

329
00:47:54,585 --> 00:47:55,742
What's her name?

330
00:47:56,236 --> 00:47:57,312
Anna.

331
00:47:58,176 --> 00:47:59,339
Is this her sister?

332
00:48:00,392 --> 00:48:01,557
That's her mommy.

333
00:48:01,918 --> 00:48:02,918
Oh.

334
00:48:05,126 --> 00:48:07,614
Oh, I bet she loves Anna so much.

335
00:48:09,549 --> 00:48:12,084
She doesn't want Anna to
get taken away again.

336
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:16,206
Who would take her away?

337
00:48:20,001 --> 00:48:21,336
The bad man.

338
00:48:22,651 --> 00:48:23,772
No.

339
00:48:26,021 --> 00:48:27,192
You see...

340
00:48:29,418 --> 00:48:30,637
Anna'a mother...

341
00:48:31,585 --> 00:48:34,126
is very, very strong.

342
00:48:35,937 --> 00:48:37,936
And she would never, ever...

343
00:48:38,798 --> 00:48:40,689
let anything like that happen again.

344
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:49,566
- Hello?
- Mama!

345
00:48:54,668 --> 00:48:55,887
Can I help you?

346
00:49:19,728 --> 00:49:21,561
No.

347
00:49:29,122 --> 00:49:31,006
No. Run!

348
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:45,835
Mama!

349
00:49:48,835 --> 00:49:50,168
Mama!

350
00:49:53,543 --> 00:49:54,585
Mama!

351
00:50:47,251 --> 00:50:48,793
We have to help them.

352
00:50:50,138 --> 00:50:52,045
What the fuck are you doing?

353
00:50:53,615 --> 00:50:54,930
I'm calling for help.

354
00:50:55,543 --> 00:50:57,204
What? For who?

355
00:50:57,769 --> 00:51:00,130
For those of us who are tired

356
00:51:00,132 --> 00:51:03,243
of having arrows shot at their
predominantly mortal heads.

357
00:51:09,747 --> 00:51:11,439
You're welcome, by the way!

358
00:51:49,543 --> 00:51:52,084
One of the last things
my daddy told me was

359
00:51:52,085 --> 00:51:54,399
that I should run from this place.

360
00:51:56,835 --> 00:51:58,178
You think that's right?

361
00:52:01,501 --> 00:52:03,491
I never thought I'd want to leave...

362
00:52:06,668 --> 00:52:08,538
but I suppose you fixed that, too.

363
00:52:13,168 --> 00:52:14,627
We're almost there.

364
00:52:18,752 --> 00:52:20,459
Let's turn 'er loose.

365
00:52:47,418 --> 00:52:49,335
That's the last of my mercy.

366
00:52:50,789 --> 00:52:52,758
Better use it fast.

367
00:53:12,877 --> 00:53:14,042
No. No!

368
00:53:14,043 --> 00:53:15,542
Hey!

369
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,234
Come on! Guys, no!

370
00:53:25,031 --> 00:53:27,042
The problem is, there isn't a problem.

371
00:53:27,043 --> 00:53:29,876
Brother, that's got to be the dumbest
fuckin' thing I've ever heard,

372
00:53:29,877 --> 00:53:31,542
and I've been to three inaugurations.

373
00:53:31,543 --> 00:53:33,167
Diagnostics, com path checks,

374
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:34,542
everything we can access is telling us

375
00:53:34,543 --> 00:53:36,185
that the system is operating normally...

376
00:53:36,186 --> 00:53:37,502
Except it isn't.

377
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:41,026
I managed to isolate certain
ops and gain control.

378
00:53:41,027 --> 00:53:43,073
We've got elevator
monitoring on most levels...

379
00:53:43,074 --> 00:53:44,668
That's great, Hawking.

380
00:53:44,669 --> 00:53:46,594
Did you shut off the killer robots?

381
00:53:47,365 --> 00:53:48,697
Well, no. The system...

382
00:53:48,699 --> 00:53:50,151
Goldberg, get in there.

383
00:53:50,153 --> 00:53:52,350
Hack the biometrics,
find me a back door.

384
00:53:52,351 --> 00:53:53,767
Hacking isn't the issue.

385
00:53:53,768 --> 00:53:56,124
The system won't allow us to
access certain protocols.

386
00:53:56,125 --> 00:53:58,917
- Systems can be forced.
- Not this one.

387
00:53:58,918 --> 00:54:02,292
Well, Ms. Hale. You got a
little present for us?

388
00:54:02,293 --> 00:54:04,630
He's in Aux Lab Three, Behavior.

389
00:54:04,631 --> 00:54:06,668
You left him there.

390
00:54:06,669 --> 00:54:08,654
He's not going anywhere.

391
00:54:08,655 --> 00:54:11,827
- Aux Three. Go!
- Yes, sir. Copy that.

392
00:54:11,828 --> 00:54:13,227
System restored.

393
00:54:13,229 --> 00:54:16,169
Fuck, yeah! We got the map back.

394
00:54:27,543 --> 00:54:29,176
What the fuck is that?

395
00:54:30,306 --> 00:54:32,165
It's the train.

396
00:55:07,847 --> 00:55:09,285
What the hell was that?

397
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:28,847
What do you see in there?

398
00:57:10,509 --> 00:57:12,467
Hello, old friend.

399
00:57:12,468 --> 00:57:18,468
