When you opened it, a little
dancer spun in the center.

I threw it in the trash.

hadn't danced in years.

And then afterwards,

79
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,690
I went to get it back,
because I felt bad,

80

Philanthropy suits you.

After all, you come from
humble beginnings yourself.

You've had plenty of feelings
about me over the years.

164
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,780
Respect isn't one of them.

You've achieved extraordinary things.

Ask anyone in this room.

Even those who didn't know
about your little project.

168

We have an agreement, Robert.

169
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,320
Delos stays out of your stories.

170
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,850
You stay out of the Valley.

171
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,940
Mm-hmm.

172
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,530
I didn't break the
agreement. Your project did.

When was the last time you took
a good look at your creation?

00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,780
At what it's been learning
about its subjects?

177
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,860
It was self-knowledge that drew you
to the park in the first place.

Be careful what you wish for.

now is the time to

You promised me. No lies.

What did you find in the Cradle?

What they're doing to James Delos...

208
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,190
they're doing to everyone
who's ever visited the park.

209
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,070
Replicating their cognition?

210
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,260
Why?

211
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,250
To turn guests into hosts?

212
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,900
You're fucking kidding.

213
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,990
That's what's in the facility.

214
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:18,360
All the guests laid bare
in code on a vast server.

215
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,440
Like the Cradle, only much bigger.

216
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:25,030
- It's called the Forge.
- Jesus.

217
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,900
That's where the hosts are headed.

218
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:31,570
Imagine what one host can do
with that trove of information.

219
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,650
That's why we need to get there first.

220
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,940
To secure it,

221
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,360
and leverage it to end all this.

222
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,240
Dictate the outcome we want.

223
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,760
Drive.

224
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,940
You say you want in.

225
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,700
Doesn't sound like the daughter I know.

226
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,840
She would have been appalled
by what we were doing.

227
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,680
Monitoring guests,

228
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,570
storing all their data...

229
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,570
What?

230
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,930
You think I'm gonna bust you
for breach of contract?

231
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,220
In some cases, the ends
justify the means.

232
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,970
All this data you have on the guests,

233
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,810
their decisions... It's precious.

234
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,970
Gives people a second chance. Even Mom.

235
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,970
But to duplicate a person,

236
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,800
you need to capture them
down to the tiniest detail.

237
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,900
I get the data you
have access to here...

238
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,150
Genetic, epigenetic, that's easy.

239
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,900
But still, you'd need
a complete picture,

240
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,770
a record of the internal
process of their cognition.

241
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:44,780
Wouldn't you?

242
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:49,200
At first we weren't sure what we'd need.

243
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,950
So we recorded everything.

244
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,490
But how?

245
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,830
You'd need to image their
minds throughout their stay.

246
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,980
Where's the scanner?

247
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,950
It was built in.

248
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,040
Didn't matter who they said they were,

249
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,130
who they thought they were.

250
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,930
We saw underneath all of that.

251
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,530
We saw inside them down to the core.

252
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,410
So this is all about your mother.

253
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,330
You wanna bring her back.

254
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:35,850
No.

00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,440
I think my dad would have
actually been proud of you.

261
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,600
Oh.

00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,900
Sorry. I know how you hate
it when I call you Billy.

- It's all right.
- No, it isn't.

I know how much it pisses you off.

I can feel it right now.

Your anger.

Guess it's time for your
yearly pilgrimage, huh?

268
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,230
What exactly do you do in the park?

269
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,280
Logan told me stories, but
I just didn't believe it.

270
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,320
I thought he was hysterical. Wasted.

271
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,440
Which I guess is what everybody
thinks I am now, huh?

275
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,140
Do you remember when we first met?

276
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,940
And I was surrounded by
all of those phonies

277
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,880
for so many years.

278
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,400
All those ruthless, powerful men

279
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,090
who hid behind those polished smiles.

280
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,290
And then there was you.

281
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,620
You wore that little shabby suit.

282
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,650
And I'd look at you and I'd think,

283
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,340
"Wow, he's the real thing.

284
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,200
The only one not faking it."

285
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,660
It turns out you're the only
one any good at faking it.

286
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,130
Good enough to get past me.

287
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,110
But not anymore.

288
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,740
- Juliet.
- No, you don't touch me,

289
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,190
you liar!

290
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,070
You fuckin' phony!

You're a fucking virus!

292
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,780
You came into this
house, into my family,

293
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,160
and you consumed it from the inside out!

294
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,150
First my brother, then my father.

295

You want her to see me like this?

What is it? You're gaslighting

You're sick.

He's not the one who's sick, Mother.

<font color="#138ce9">EMILY:</font> It's not all right.

have to take you back.

No, no, no.

00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,690
I'm not going back to that prison.

307
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:14,030
That was a horrible place. They
made me feel like I was crazy.

308
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:17,570
Mom, they treat you like an addict.

309
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,430
Which you are.

310
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,330
Emily, please, I don't need that.

311
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:27,420
I'm fine. I'm really
fine. I just need...

312
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,750
to rest.

313
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,150
I'm not going back
there. I'm really tired.

314
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,150
All I need is a little
rest. I promise you.

315
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,650
It's all right. It's all
right. Let's go upstairs.
