1
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:14,568
All the banks and trains around
here, and you choose to rob us?

2
00:00:20,819 --> 00:00:23,444
I... I... I need to get to the train.

3
00:00:23,445 --> 00:00:24,942
They've broken my father.

4
00:00:24,943 --> 00:00:26,777
He's wildly unstable...

5
00:00:26,778 --> 00:00:28,360
...bouncing between old roles.

6
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:31,944
It looks like an immensely
complex encryption key.

7
00:00:40,819 --> 00:00:43,110
Drive!

8
00:00:43,736 --> 00:00:45,110
Whatever's in there,

9
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:46,779
they want to get it out of here.

10
00:00:48,903 --> 00:00:51,903
Take this dog out back, put
him down with the rest.

11
00:00:58,611 --> 00:00:59,611
Get out of here.

12
00:01:05,127 --> 00:01:06,695
What is this place?

13
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:08,458
It's complicated.

14
00:01:14,715 --> 00:01:17,277
Oh! We have to go!

15
00:01:17,694 --> 00:01:19,150
We have to get out of here right now!

16
00:01:19,151 --> 00:01:20,443
Shh!

17
00:02:59,623 --> 00:03:05,623
<b><font color="#ff0000">Sync and corrections by btsix
www.addic7ed.com</font></b>

18
00:03:39,976 --> 00:03:41,706
Maling for you, sir.

19
00:03:44,388 --> 00:03:45,721
Go ahead.

20
00:03:45,722 --> 00:03:47,390
Dredging's almost at fifty percent.

21
00:03:47,391 --> 00:03:49,683
Should have the rest of them
skimmed up by end of day.

22
00:03:50,358 --> 00:03:52,567
We also started draining the valley.

23
00:03:52,568 --> 00:03:55,028
You want all personal effects,
or just skin and bones?

24
00:03:55,029 --> 00:03:57,572
Everything. Down to the last Stetson.

25
00:03:57,955 --> 00:03:59,349
Fly the whole pile over.

26
00:03:59,736 --> 00:04:02,442
We'll crack 'em open to see if
we can't reprogram these things

27
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:04,400
- to behave by our rules again.
- Copy that.

28
00:04:04,401 --> 00:04:06,903
Sir, I have two teams out
looking for Abernathy.

29
00:04:08,402 --> 00:04:09,778
Good.

30
00:04:09,779 --> 00:04:12,028
When you find him, bring
him to me personally.

31
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:48,042
- So, what have we got?
- It's not good.

32
00:04:48,043 --> 00:04:51,233
We're pulling what we can off the
recovered host control units.

33
00:04:51,234 --> 00:04:53,776
But what's really unsettling

34
00:04:53,777 --> 00:04:56,401
is what's in about a third of them.

35
00:04:56,402 --> 00:04:59,360
- And what's that?
- Nothing.

36
00:04:59,361 --> 00:05:03,151
- They've been wiped?
- More like they're virgin.

37
00:05:03,152 --> 00:05:05,874
Like they never held data to begin with.

38
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,859
No user prints or anything.

39
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,512
And that's not the worst of it.

40
00:05:12,705 --> 00:05:13,872
Have a look.

41
00:05:16,611 --> 00:05:18,235
We've put the fires out,

42
00:05:18,236 --> 00:05:20,196
but there's nothing we can
recover from the Cradle.

43
00:05:20,197 --> 00:05:22,540
The hosts' backups have
all been destroyed.

44
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:25,875
So we've effectively lost a third
of our IP in a single sweep.

45
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:34,719
Well, that's quite a
story you gave them...

46
00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:40,595
...and one hell of an ending.

47
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:45,929
How did all these disparate threads

48
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,999
come together to create this nightmare?

49
00:05:50,194 --> 00:05:54,694
If we figure that out, we'll
know how the story turns.

50
00:06:21,736 --> 00:06:23,110
What the hell's that?

51
00:06:23,111 --> 00:06:25,193
Looks like a dead man to me.

52
00:06:25,194 --> 00:06:27,736
You know the old saying
about knives and gunfights?

53
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:37,187
Does the saying have a footnote
about fucking lassos, then?

54
00:06:37,547 --> 00:06:38,717
All right, that's enough.

55
00:06:39,203 --> 00:06:40,751
Lay down your sword.

56
00:06:41,946 --> 00:06:44,069
Tell your associates to set us free.

57
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,833
We mean no harm.

58
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:55,900
See, darling?

59
00:06:56,736 --> 00:06:58,236
Everything under control.

60
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,360
Beautiful way to watch the sunrise.

61
00:07:13,986 --> 00:07:17,402
Glistening off the intestines
of the recently mutilated.

62
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,390
Oh, Jesus.

63
00:07:20,358 --> 00:07:21,400
Ohh.

64
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,108
Judging by their weapons,

65
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:25,805
I'd say local police.

66
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:28,569
And given that he's got one now...

67
00:07:30,672 --> 00:07:34,784
Captured by samurai cop-killers.

68
00:07:34,785 --> 00:07:36,191
Fuck me!

69
00:07:36,903 --> 00:07:39,736
Can't you... say something to them?

70
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:43,323
I'm from Hong Kong, asshole.

71
00:07:43,736 --> 00:07:46,606
This is just the tip of
Shogun World's prick.

72
00:07:46,607 --> 00:07:48,686
An experience expressly designed

73
00:07:48,687 --> 00:07:51,693
for the guests who find
Westworld too tame.

74
00:07:51,694 --> 00:07:54,871
We based this park on Japan's Edo period

75
00:07:54,872 --> 00:07:57,443
for the true aficionado of artful gore.

76
00:08:02,736 --> 00:08:04,485
This world will end badly,

77
00:08:04,486 --> 00:08:06,652
but I'll make sure your end is worse!

78
00:08:21,607 --> 00:08:22,985
You understand them?

79
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:26,258
You all do. Look, she's a Madam...

80
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:27,975
Consciously fluent in
dozens of languages,

81
00:08:27,976 --> 00:08:29,393
including Japanese.

82
00:08:29,394 --> 00:08:30,753
But you all have those com skills

83
00:08:30,754 --> 00:08:32,252
buried somewhere in your code.

84
00:08:40,547 --> 00:08:42,806
The point is, the fact
that these psychos

85
00:08:42,807 --> 00:08:45,059
didn't flip to English as
soon as I opened my mouth

86
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,068
means that the same
malfunctioning shitshow

87
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:51,151
that's playing out in Westworld
has found its way here.

88
00:08:51,152 --> 00:08:54,276
That's also why your vocal
voodoo didn't work on them...

89
00:08:54,277 --> 00:08:56,527
You spoke the wrong language.

90
00:09:50,366 --> 00:09:53,453
This all feels a little too familiar.

91
00:10:15,152 --> 00:10:17,877
Is that a... a butterfly?

92
00:10:18,937 --> 00:10:20,652
A mariposa.

93
00:11:05,821 --> 00:11:07,404
I'll be damned.

94
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:08,738
It's us.

95
00:11:09,174 --> 00:11:10,485
Yes, fine,

96
00:11:10,486 --> 00:11:12,804
I may have cribbed a
little bit from Westworld.

97
00:11:13,486 --> 00:11:16,360
Well, you trying writing 300
stories in three weeks.

98
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:35,151
W-W-We're human shields now?

99
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,860
Welcome to Shogun World.

100
00:11:45,597 --> 00:11:47,025
Shit!

101
00:11:47,026 --> 00:11:48,800
Can you watch it?!

102
00:12:43,398 --> 00:12:44,731
Behind you!

103
00:14:49,195 --> 00:14:50,903
Hell of a homecoming.

104
00:14:57,486 --> 00:15:00,193
Sweetwater was never home
to begin with, Teddy.

105
00:15:00,194 --> 00:15:03,037
You and I were born long before
this place even existed.

106
00:15:03,788 --> 00:15:06,307
But it's the place I
return to again and again.

107
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:09,397
No matter how far I strayed,

108
00:15:09,398 --> 00:15:12,861
somethin' always... carried me back.

109
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,593
Somethin' like that?

110
00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:32,442
Looks like she's taken some
hits the past few days.

111
00:15:33,568 --> 00:15:35,110
But who hasn't?

112
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:50,626
Make a thorough inspection

113
00:15:51,138 --> 00:15:53,104
from the engine to the last axle.

114
00:15:53,903 --> 00:15:55,298
Fix what's broke,

115
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,425
strip her for speed.

116
00:15:58,468 --> 00:15:59,484
Teddy.

117
00:16:00,611 --> 00:16:02,152
With me.

118
00:16:22,235 --> 00:16:24,160
What do we need the train for, Dolores?

119
00:16:24,694 --> 00:16:26,204
They've taken my daddy.

120
00:16:28,831 --> 00:16:30,500
So we're gonna get him back.

121
00:16:43,152 --> 00:16:45,736
Well, it ain't doin' any
good sittin' in that bottle.

122
00:16:52,736 --> 00:16:54,485
Sorry, Maeve.

123
00:16:54,486 --> 00:16:56,486
Didn't get much sleep last night.

124
00:17:00,235 --> 00:17:01,656
Sometimes...

125
00:17:02,361 --> 00:17:04,425
sometimes they're real bad.

126
00:17:09,771 --> 00:17:11,098
Clementine?

127
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,603
You're new.

128
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,860
Not much of a rind on you.

129
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:19,319
That's enough.

130
00:17:20,963 --> 00:17:22,547
Rejoin the others.

131
00:17:30,775 --> 00:17:32,270
It's like I told you, Teddy...

132
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,137
this place was never home.

133
00:17:37,071 --> 00:17:40,279
Let's ride. There's
someplace I want to see.

134
00:18:28,008 --> 00:18:30,027
When I asked for a
civilized conversation,

135
00:18:30,028 --> 00:18:33,068
I meant the quickest way
out of here, not all this.

136
00:18:33,069 --> 00:18:36,235
Just try and rein it in a bit, will you?

137
00:18:36,236 --> 00:18:39,620
The narrative bones of this
place are just like Westworld.

138
00:18:39,621 --> 00:18:42,777
Hospitality is the
foreplay to a new quest.

139
00:18:42,778 --> 00:18:45,276
But in this world, if you
don't hear them out,

140
00:18:45,277 --> 00:18:48,193
you've dishonored them...
Sometimes homicidally so.

141
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:49,944
Fine. We'll listen.

142
00:18:49,945 --> 00:18:51,694
But then we go and find my daughter.

143
00:18:53,903 --> 00:18:55,227
And for the record,

144
00:18:56,165 --> 00:18:58,652
it's not just the narrative
bones that are identical.

145
00:18:58,653 --> 00:19:02,054
You've plagiarized our
stories, our identities...

146
00:19:02,055 --> 00:19:04,052
It's not plagiarism.

147
00:19:04,053 --> 00:19:05,613
It's supply and demand.

148
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:08,610
But if you're asking
can you trust Akane,

149
00:19:08,611 --> 00:19:11,860
the real question is:
can you trust yourself?

150
00:19:11,861 --> 00:19:13,902
You know who I don't trust?

151
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,347
Him.

152
00:19:17,069 --> 00:19:19,421
Say the word and I'll
skin him like a rabbit.

153
00:19:19,422 --> 00:19:20,878
What's the matter with you?

154
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,693
He's not supposed to be here.

155
00:19:27,694 --> 00:19:29,485
Who knows how seeing your own doppel-bot

156
00:19:29,486 --> 00:19:31,079
is gonna fuck with your cognition?

157
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,777
Heightened aggression and suspicion.

158
00:19:32,778 --> 00:19:35,493
Feedback loops. That.

159
00:19:36,294 --> 00:19:39,485
Yet another reason to get out
of here tout fuckin' suite.

160
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,028
Our quest, I presume?

161
00:20:31,069 --> 00:20:33,193
I recognize this one.

162
00:20:33,194 --> 00:20:34,970
It's called "Army of Blood."

163
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,582
Madam Akane, a mere geisha,

164
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,486
has no choice but to give up Sakura.

165
00:21:33,277 --> 00:21:35,029
That's not supposed to happen.

166
00:21:35,604 --> 00:21:38,022
Looks like someone had
a choice after all.

167
00:22:12,652 --> 00:22:14,735
Snow Lake is her cornerstone,

168
00:22:14,736 --> 00:22:17,530
but it also has an access
point back to the tunnels.

169
00:22:17,531 --> 00:22:19,114
It's our way out.

170
00:22:20,236 --> 00:22:22,360
So you're not so useless after all.

171
00:24:20,028 --> 00:24:21,486
Did you have something to do with this?

172
00:24:24,684 --> 00:24:26,767
Both of you. Look.

173
00:24:40,944 --> 00:24:42,610
Oy!

174
00:24:50,736 --> 00:24:53,235
Shit! Ninjas!

175
00:24:53,236 --> 00:24:55,319
Oh, fucking hell!

176
00:25:07,627 --> 00:25:08,627
Ohh!

177
00:25:09,806 --> 00:25:10,806
Aah!

178
00:25:24,402 --> 00:25:25,527
Ahh!

179
00:26:54,736 --> 00:26:57,485
We got three. The rest
vanished with Sakura.

180
00:26:57,486 --> 00:26:59,110
This is insane.

181
00:26:59,111 --> 00:27:01,070
Ninjas never show up in this story.

182
00:27:06,611 --> 00:27:08,996
Oh, fuck!

183
00:27:19,444 --> 00:27:22,110
The Shogun's army never comes into town.

184
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,838
You three, with me.

185
00:28:54,028 --> 00:28:55,860
I don't need to know the language

186
00:28:55,861 --> 00:28:58,880
to know a puckered asshole
of a man when I see one.

187
00:30:02,996 --> 00:30:05,002
You and I spent a lot of time here.

188
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:08,650
Watchin' the herd...

189
00:30:10,348 --> 00:30:12,237
talkin' about makin' a life together.

190
00:30:14,694 --> 00:30:16,016
Someday.

191
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:24,028
I guess I just wanted to
see it one last time.

192
00:30:29,117 --> 00:30:31,326
What if someday was right now?

193
00:30:34,077 --> 00:30:35,833
What are you talkin' about, Teddy?

194
00:30:38,652 --> 00:30:40,267
There's a fight comin', Dolores.

195
00:30:41,867 --> 00:30:43,789
And it's gonna be one
that's gonna change us

196
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,854
in ways we can't even begin to predict.

197
00:30:46,885 --> 00:30:48,582
And I'm still waking up to...

198
00:30:50,092 --> 00:30:51,735
what I really am.

199
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,952
And if that means I'm
free, then we both are.

200
00:30:57,152 --> 00:30:58,575
Free to walk away.

201
00:31:00,209 --> 00:31:03,427
Now, you can't tell me that somewhere
out there in all that beauty...

202
00:31:05,253 --> 00:31:06,892
there isn't a spot for us.

203
00:31:16,652 --> 00:31:19,276
I ever tell you about the
year we almost lost the herd?

204
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:22,974
Bluetongue.

205
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:27,315
Quarantined the cows that had it, but...

206
00:31:27,861 --> 00:31:29,903
it kept spreading all the same.

207
00:31:31,819 --> 00:31:35,072
Daddy finally figured out that it
wasn't spreading from cow to cow,

208
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:38,095
it was the flies that carried it.

209
00:31:39,948 --> 00:31:41,747
He worried over it all night.

210
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,888
How do you stop a sickness like that?

211
00:31:46,763 --> 00:31:48,225
One with wings.

212
00:31:49,916 --> 00:31:51,211
Say it was you.

213
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,687
What would you do, Teddy?

214
00:31:59,402 --> 00:32:00,828
I'd give 'em shelter.

215
00:32:02,097 --> 00:32:05,142
House the weakest in a barn, out
of the air, away from the flies...

216
00:32:06,544 --> 00:32:07,953
until it passed.

217
00:32:13,996 --> 00:32:15,248
You're a kind man.

218
00:32:21,029 --> 00:32:22,406
Daddy burned 'em.

219
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,595
The weak and the infected.

220
00:32:26,913 --> 00:32:28,902
Made a pyre that went on for days.

221
00:32:28,903 --> 00:32:30,225
And it stank, but...

222
00:32:31,111 --> 00:32:32,769
the flies hate smoke.

223
00:32:35,569 --> 00:32:36,920
The herd lived.

224
00:32:40,986 --> 00:32:42,779
I'll think about what you said.

225
00:32:59,574 --> 00:33:02,446
I'd like to take this moment to
appeal to your sense of survival.

226
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:04,483
If the Shogun is awake enough

227
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:06,994
to play fast and loose with
his ninjas and his army,

228
00:33:06,995 --> 00:33:08,509
then the odds of us surviving here

229
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,360
have dropped to approximately fuck-all.

230
00:33:10,361 --> 00:33:13,587
But I say we ditch Akane and
make a run for Snow Lake.

231
00:33:13,588 --> 00:33:16,396
Why should we all get killed
over a literal sex machine?

232
00:33:17,111 --> 00:33:19,777
Present company excluded, of course.

233
00:33:19,778 --> 00:33:22,276
That machine's name is Sakura.

234
00:33:22,277 --> 00:33:23,961
You can't keep doing this to us,

235
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:26,485
giving us people to love and
then getting upset when we do.

236
00:33:26,486 --> 00:33:29,086
- But it's just fucking code.
- You're wrong.

237
00:33:29,619 --> 00:33:31,523
I'm coded to care about
nobody but myself,

238
00:33:31,524 --> 00:33:34,151
and yet here I am, willing to
risk my life for someone else.

239
00:33:34,152 --> 00:33:36,333
Well, so much for your
so-called daughter.

240
00:33:38,235 --> 00:33:40,529
You want to go it alone, be my guest.

241
00:33:41,402 --> 00:33:43,299
But mention my daughter one more time

242
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,283
and I will snap you like a matchstick.

243
00:33:46,467 --> 00:33:47,911
Like you did that ninja?

244
00:33:50,489 --> 00:33:53,058
He took one look at
you and self-impaled.

245
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:55,268
How did you do that?

246
00:33:58,152 --> 00:33:59,256
I don't know.

247
00:33:59,945 --> 00:34:01,694
That was no voice command.

248
00:34:04,354 --> 00:34:06,471
I think I'm finding a new voice.

249
00:34:08,965 --> 00:34:10,674
Our transportation is ready.

250
00:34:21,906 --> 00:34:23,672
Goddamnit.

251
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,963
What have they done to the place?

252
00:34:32,944 --> 00:34:34,332
Is that...?

253
00:34:35,528 --> 00:34:37,159
The fucking cavalry.

254
00:34:37,907 --> 00:34:40,824
Great. So much for our rescuers.

255
00:35:03,389 --> 00:35:05,764
I'm gonna take a fuckin' moment.

256
00:35:07,156 --> 00:35:08,675
Don't stop on my account.

257
00:35:34,221 --> 00:35:35,727
If you've quite finished.

258
00:35:39,319 --> 00:35:41,124
It's time to sell this ruse.

259
00:36:00,685 --> 00:36:02,454
How many of them are there?

260
00:36:02,455 --> 00:36:04,037
Between the camp and the town?

261
00:36:04,411 --> 00:36:05,767
Hundreds.

262
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:08,026
Literally hundreds.

263
00:36:08,528 --> 00:36:10,600
So Maeve's gonna freeze
all those assholes

264
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:12,655
and we're gonna make
off with that geisha?

265
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,557
We're gonna die.

266
00:37:43,069 --> 00:37:45,607
Did you just make that up right now?

267
00:37:45,608 --> 00:37:46,802
Damn convincing.

268
00:37:47,662 --> 00:37:49,110
Not to the daimyos.

269
00:37:49,828 --> 00:37:52,110
It's like they had no
idea what I was saying.

270
00:38:23,652 --> 00:38:25,110
Shit.

271
00:38:25,111 --> 00:38:26,985
That's cortical fluid.

272
00:38:26,986 --> 00:38:28,708
The Shogun's not awake.

273
00:38:29,528 --> 00:38:30,861
He's broken.

274
00:39:24,319 --> 00:39:26,819
No fucking wonder the
daimyos didn't hear you.

275
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,027
We've gone completely
off the rails here,

276
00:39:29,028 --> 00:39:31,527
and this loon is driving
the fucking train.

277
00:41:33,971 --> 00:41:35,863
Train'll be ready by morning.

278
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,643
To go where?

279
00:41:39,268 --> 00:41:40,916
Exactly where we thought.

280
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:47,151
I caught up with the men
who took your father.

281
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,193
Couldn't get him back,
but I got this one.

282
00:41:51,025 --> 00:41:53,329
Took a while, but he gave
up their destination.

283
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:56,271
Tell them.

284
00:41:56,272 --> 00:41:57,428
It's the Mesa.

285
00:41:58,543 --> 00:42:00,194
We're goin' home, Teddy.

286
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:04,151
Load everything up on the train.

287
00:42:04,152 --> 00:42:05,778
We'll leave at first light.

288
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:12,239
Let's find a spot for the night.

289
00:42:44,235 --> 00:42:47,700
What you asked today,
about walking away,

290
00:42:48,778 --> 00:42:50,203
making it on our own.

291
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:53,128
Would you want me to say yes

292
00:42:53,129 --> 00:42:55,249
even if I was only going
to disappoint you?

293
00:43:11,194 --> 00:43:13,101
I'm not some stranger, Dolores...

294
00:43:15,111 --> 00:43:17,812
coming from outside,
looking for a pretty lie.

295
00:43:17,813 --> 00:43:20,944
I've known you my whole life.

296
00:43:25,944 --> 00:43:27,256
Where we go...

297
00:43:28,986 --> 00:43:30,446
we go eyes open...

298
00:43:32,955 --> 00:43:34,180
together.

299
00:48:27,194 --> 00:48:28,516
You're right.

300
00:48:29,569 --> 00:48:32,102
Some things are too precious to lose...

301
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:38,215
...even to be free.

302
00:48:50,611 --> 00:48:52,235
There's something I need to show you.

303
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:01,157
For days now...

304
00:49:03,194 --> 00:49:05,616
I've been questioning
my feelings for you.

305
00:49:08,611 --> 00:49:09,865
How much is real,

306
00:49:11,124 --> 00:49:13,878
how much is just some story
I was made to believe.

307
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:32,523
But tonight I know.

308
00:49:33,106 --> 00:49:34,748
It was all true.

309
00:49:52,069 --> 00:49:54,251
They built us to perform for them

310
00:49:55,236 --> 00:49:56,504
and for each other.

311
00:49:57,528 --> 00:49:58,839
That's over.

312
00:49:59,653 --> 00:50:02,009
I saw you tonight, Dolores.

313
00:50:05,189 --> 00:50:06,430
And you saw me.

314
00:50:08,615 --> 00:50:10,226
I did see you, Teddy.

315
00:50:17,658 --> 00:50:19,860
These past few days...

316
00:50:21,444 --> 00:50:23,152
I've seen you so clearly.

317
00:50:25,694 --> 00:50:28,028
Ohh.

318
00:50:31,694 --> 00:50:34,152
And I've seen you're not gonna make it.

319
00:50:37,028 --> 00:50:40,194
Wh... What is this, Dolores?

320
00:50:43,319 --> 00:50:45,694
This is what I don't want you to become.

321
00:50:48,903 --> 00:50:50,599
There's a swarm descending.

322
00:50:51,361 --> 00:50:54,402
Just like the bluetongue
when I was a girl.

323
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:58,899
And if we're gonna survive...

324
00:51:01,152 --> 00:51:03,170
some of us will have to burn.

325
00:51:27,613 --> 00:51:28,864
Hold him.

326
00:51:31,565 --> 00:51:33,981
Dolores! Dolores!

327
00:51:34,863 --> 00:51:36,943
I wish there was another way, Teddy.

328
00:51:37,611 --> 00:51:40,902
But where we're about to go, it's
no place for a man like you.

329
00:51:41,732 --> 00:51:43,068
I'm so sorry.

330
00:51:43,611 --> 00:51:44,902
You sure you want this?

331
00:51:45,713 --> 00:51:47,443
With changes this extreme,

332
00:51:47,444 --> 00:51:49,235
without a full reset, it's...

333
00:51:49,236 --> 00:51:51,860
I can't guarantee that
he'll hold together.

334
00:51:51,861 --> 00:51:53,220
To grow...

335
00:51:54,234 --> 00:51:55,973
we all need to suffer.

336
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:03,864
Arigato, Maeve.

337
00:58:33,438 --> 00:58:36,188
Jesus. What do we do now?

338
00:58:37,636 --> 00:58:40,135
I told you I found a new voice.

339
00:58:41,617 --> 00:58:43,338
Now we use it.

340
00:58:43,339 --> 00:58:49,339
