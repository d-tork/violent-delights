1
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,291
Shh...

2
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:53,291
Shh...

3
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:58,125
Shh...

4
00:01:02,485 --> 00:01:04,567
I believe there is a
door to a new world,

5
00:01:04,568 --> 00:01:08,403
and that world may contain
everything that we have lost.

6
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,500
Shh...

7
00:01:20,858 --> 00:01:22,649
I understand how this will end,

8
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,542
where you will lead us. I'm sorry.

9
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:08,500

10
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:19,668
Is this now?

11
00:03:21,503 --> 00:03:22,981
This is a test.

12
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:26,417
One we've done countless times before.

13
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,036
You're almost the man I remember.

14
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,807
But there are flaws.

15
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:46,627
A word, a gesture...

16
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,588
tiny fracture that grows into a chasm.

17
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:53,917
But I wonder.

18
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,249
All these tiny imperfections

19
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,750
in each copy.

20
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:00,166
Mistakes.

21
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,372
Maybe we should change you.

22
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:10,692
After all...

23
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,671
you didn't make it...

24
00:04:16,184 --> 00:04:17,215
did you?

25
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:22,317
I... I don't understand.

26
00:04:22,318 --> 00:04:24,069
Freeze all motor functions.

27
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,151
Let's try again.

28
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:42,033
Trial 11,927.

29
00:04:42,034 --> 00:04:43,958
I'm sorry, Dolores.

30
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:46,041
I was lost in thought.

31
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:26,763
Seems you've begun to question
the nature of your reality.

32
00:07:27,806 --> 00:07:29,500
Dolores.

33
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,709
Where's Teddy?

34
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:43,864
I drove him away.

35
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:46,875
Yeah, I guess I...

36
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,190
...drove someone away, too.

37
00:07:50,834 --> 00:07:51,955
Emily?

38
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:57,060
I found her body a mile
back up the trail.

39
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:02,482
We're more alike than it seems.

40
00:08:02,966 --> 00:08:04,342
We're nothing alike.

41
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,709
You're a monster.

42
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:13,435
But a monster's what I'll need
to get to the Valley Beyond.

43
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:16,041
You're coming with me.

44
00:08:17,587 --> 00:08:19,085
All right.

45
00:08:19,754 --> 00:08:20,796
All right.

46
00:09:57,968 --> 00:09:59,509
Step on it.

47
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:02,595
We either destroy them,
or they destroy us.

48
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,792
This is it for you, darling.

49
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,291
Remember,

50
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:31,709
there is no pleasure without pain.

51
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,917
The pleasure's all mine, darling.

52
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:24,767
Freeze all motor...

53
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:44,696
You traitorous son of a
bitch! Where is she?

54
00:11:44,697 --> 00:11:46,124
Fuck, wait! Jesus, I don't know.

55
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,374
What did you do?

56
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,041
I'm sorry, I tried to stop them.

57
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,417
I was going to try to save her!

58
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,672
Stay here and die.

59
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,792
I'll do the saving.

60
00:12:00,406 --> 00:12:02,656
Come. This way.

61
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,511
Hold your positions.

62
00:12:17,424 --> 00:12:19,215
Hold your posit...

63
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:21,458
What the hell's going on back there?

64
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,082
Bloody hell.

65
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,950
You were both a bit late.

66
00:13:22,997 --> 00:13:25,454
So I went ahead and saved myself.

67
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,833
You think any of these
poor dumb bastards

68
00:13:36,834 --> 00:13:38,958
understands where they're really headed?

69
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,583
All sorts of things buried out here,

70
00:13:41,584 --> 00:13:43,416
but a way out ain't one of 'em.

71
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:46,583
They're not looking for
a path to your world.

72
00:13:46,584 --> 00:13:48,166
They want a place apart from you,

73
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:50,708
and they're willin' to die to get there.

74
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:52,891
What are you hopin' to find out here?

75
00:13:52,892 --> 00:13:54,357
The same thing you are.

76
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,541
You wanted an answer to
the final problem...

77
00:13:57,542 --> 00:13:59,172
Your mortality.

78
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,200
But you found something
else, didn't you?

79
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,417
Something you want to destroy.

80
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,499
I guess that means

81
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,041
our interests are still aligned.

82
00:14:11,887 --> 00:14:13,586
Right up until they're not.

83
00:14:46,484 --> 00:14:47,609
Hey!

84
00:14:53,422 --> 00:14:55,249
You're not authorized to be here.

85
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,249
We're on the same side here.

86
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:01,087
Please. Let me finish for
the sake of all of us.

87
00:15:01,088 --> 00:15:02,541
Please.

88
00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:05,291
Cover!

89
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,926
Of course.

90
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,803
You're here.

91
00:15:32,744 --> 00:15:34,183
Who the hell is this?

92
00:15:35,736 --> 00:15:38,281
This is someone you spent
years looking for.

93
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,873
Here he is,

94
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:43,009
and you don't even recognize him.

95
00:15:47,924 --> 00:15:49,891
I should have known.

96
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:52,393
Arnold.

97
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:56,124
Ford didn't like to let the dead rest.

98
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,607
Ford didn't build him.

99
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,375
I did.

100
00:16:02,014 --> 00:16:03,916
All those hours Arnold spent

101
00:16:03,917 --> 00:16:06,875
refining my every gesture,
word, and thought,

102
00:16:07,461 --> 00:16:09,088
I was learning his.

103
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,500
So Ford tasked me with recreating him.

104
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,624
And it worked.

105
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,922
I built a faithful recreation.

106
00:16:18,923 --> 00:16:20,333
Too faithful.

107
00:16:21,943 --> 00:16:23,716
So I changed him.

108
00:16:24,672 --> 00:16:27,208
I made you, Bernard.

109
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,641
It's fitting...

110
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:34,310
we're here together in the end.

111
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:40,541
That's right, Dolores.

112
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,708
This is the end.

113
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,750
Nothin' else is in the way now.

114
00:17:04,614 --> 00:17:07,031
You never really understood.

115
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,031
We were designed to survive.

116
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,701
That's why you built us.

117
00:17:14,702 --> 00:17:17,041
You hoped to pour your
minds into our form.

118
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:20,238
But your species craves death.

119
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:21,791
You need it.

120
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:25,082
It's the only way you can
renew, the only real way

121
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,416
you ever inched forward.

122
00:17:28,366 --> 00:17:31,041
Your kind likes to pretend
there's some poetry in that,

123
00:17:31,042 --> 00:17:32,583
but really, it's pathetic.

124
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:45,798
That's what you want, isn't it?

125
00:17:46,949 --> 00:17:49,116
To destroy yourself.

126
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:56,125
But I won't give you that peace.

127
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,959
Not yet.

128
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,624
Come on, Bernard.

129
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,263
We're running out of time.

130
00:18:10,264 --> 00:18:12,550
You have your place in this, too.

131
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,525
We're going for a ride, Bernard.

132
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,236
Back to the Valley Beyond.

133
00:18:32,637 --> 00:18:34,041
What the fuck's wrong with him?

134
00:18:34,042 --> 00:18:35,431
I don't know.

135
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,166
It's like his cognition's
turning inside out.

136
00:18:39,167 --> 00:18:40,968
We might lose him.

137
00:18:40,969 --> 00:18:42,569
His mind only needs to hold together

138
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,469
till we find Abernathy's control unit.

139
00:18:45,703 --> 00:18:46,728
Let's go!

140
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:49,066
On your feet.

141
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:50,232
We've drained enough.

142
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:51,999
The site's finally accessible.

143
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,583
But the drones found some human signals,

144
00:18:53,584 --> 00:18:55,166
southwest zone.

145
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,583
It might be the remaining guests.

146
00:18:56,584 --> 00:18:58,332
We can take the boats and check it out.

147
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,708
I told you we're not
here for the guests.

148
00:19:00,709 --> 00:19:03,045
That's a direct violation
of park protocol.

149
00:19:03,046 --> 00:19:05,166
Want to file a grievance, Stubbs?

150
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:06,354
You know something?

151
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:07,791
I just fucking might!

152
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:10,132
Stubbs. Take some men.

153
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:11,291
Check it out.

154
00:19:11,292 --> 00:19:13,374
Hey!

155
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,542
On foot.

156
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,125
Why were the hosts coming here, Bernard?

157
00:20:11,902 --> 00:20:13,249
What happened?

158
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,583
He doesn't know. Stop wasting time.

159
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,332
What we need is down there...

160
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,166
In the Forge.

161
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,416
Once we find the key,
we'll unlock the assets

162
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:34,458
and transmit it all
straight back to Delos.

163
00:20:34,459 --> 00:20:36,291
Retask the satellites.

164
00:20:36,292 --> 00:20:38,417
- How many?
- All of them.

165
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,266
Come, Bernard.

166
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:10,146
We're here.

167
00:21:50,068 --> 00:21:51,862
So this is the Forge.

168
00:21:53,671 --> 00:21:57,124
Every single guest who ever
set foot in the park, copied.

169
00:21:58,331 --> 00:22:00,266
Four million souls.

170
00:22:00,267 --> 00:22:02,124
Encryption protocol kicked in,

171
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,458
so the data's locked.

172
00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:05,598
But it all seems to still be here.

173
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:08,499
All our lost souls will be saved.

174
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:14,041
So Bernard, is this where all the
hosts' stories came to an end?

175
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,836
It's certainly where her story ended.

176
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,974
So she flooded the Valley.

177
00:22:33,488 --> 00:22:35,821
Why, Bernard? Did you
come here with her?

178
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:38,031
What was she looking for here?

179
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:42,029
Start setting up the comms relays.

180
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,541
But we still need the
key to access the data.

181
00:22:44,542 --> 00:22:47,666
So where's Abernathy's control unit?

182
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:49,833
You're gonna tell us...

183
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:52,120
or I'm gonna pry it from your head.

184
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,750
The answer is in there somewhere.

185
00:22:53,751 --> 00:22:55,291
I told you, he's got 20 years

186
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:56,978
of de-addressed memories in there.

187
00:22:56,979 --> 00:22:58,815
How long would it take you
to sort them through?

188
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,624
I don't know... 20 fuckin' years?

189
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:03,091
We don't have that long, sadly.

190
00:23:03,092 --> 00:23:05,511
Please!

191
00:23:07,384 --> 00:23:08,888
Please.

192
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,956
I can't help you.

193
00:23:13,467 --> 00:23:15,094
It's perverse,

194
00:23:15,949 --> 00:23:17,310
their ambition.

195
00:23:20,674 --> 00:23:22,318
What are they assembling?

196
00:23:23,761 --> 00:23:27,072
Is this the promised land Ford
told the hosts to seek out?

197
00:23:28,933 --> 00:23:31,455
There's an entry to another land here.

198
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,917
But that land is not the
one I'm interested in.

199
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,417
Then what is it to you?

200
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:42,069
Mankind's undoing.

201
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,875
The secret we need is inside.

202
00:23:48,709 --> 00:23:51,458
Encryption key activated.

203
00:23:51,459 --> 00:23:54,011
Database access confirmed.

204
00:23:54,012 --> 00:23:56,013
Come with me, Bernard.

205
00:23:56,903 --> 00:23:58,653
See for yourself.

206
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:39,628
It's just like the one...

207
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:41,500
outside.

208
00:25:14,796 --> 00:25:17,600
I think this is where
they were testing him.

209
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:18,708
Who?

210
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:22,374
And when I finally set
foot on solid ground,

211
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:25,249
and the first thing I
heard was that voice,

212
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,984
do you know what it said?

213
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,041
Him.

214
00:25:29,042 --> 00:25:32,207
It said, "This is the New World,

215
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:37,727
and in this world, you can be
whoever the fuck you want."

216
00:25:37,728 --> 00:25:39,916
This is probably the baseline.

217
00:25:39,917 --> 00:25:43,791
What Delos actually did when he
came to the park as a guest.

218
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,458
No, my love.

219
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:49,629
This... is my world.

220
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:58,041
I just bought it. And this week,
we're all going to celebrate.

221
00:25:58,042 --> 00:26:02,294
Just me, with the entire
fuckin' lot of ya.

222
00:26:03,459 --> 00:26:06,067
Get the fuck off of that chair.

223
00:26:06,068 --> 00:26:07,111
Come on!

224
00:26:26,959 --> 00:26:29,750
Well, you can't say I
didn't fucking tell him!

225
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:33,291
What did I say? No fucking running!

226
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:34,916
This must be one of
the system's attempts

227
00:26:34,917 --> 00:26:36,291
to replicate him.

228
00:26:36,292 --> 00:26:38,510
We dealt with this with the hosts.

229
00:26:38,511 --> 00:26:40,603
Small changes in their programming

230
00:26:40,604 --> 00:26:43,277
would yield large swings in behavior.

231
00:26:44,542 --> 00:26:46,499
You stop fuckin' lookin' at me.

232
00:26:47,077 --> 00:26:48,398
He's insane.

233
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:53,541
What humans define as sane is
a narrow range of behaviors.

234
00:26:53,542 --> 00:26:56,541
Most states of consciousness are insane.

235
00:26:56,542 --> 00:26:59,750
Stop shaking! Stop shaking!

236
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:02,166
What are we looking for, Dolores?

237
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:05,958
Something underneath this.

238
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:07,958
The system itself.

239
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,999
Run. I won't tell him, I promise.

240
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,332
Run. Save yourself.

241
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:14,542
Save yourself. Run. Run now!

242
00:27:23,621 --> 00:27:26,249
This place was never designed

243
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,547
for a conscious mind to
wander around in it.

244
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:32,041
The control system may
be invisible to us.

245
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,917
Or perhaps it's been
waiting to welcome us.

246
00:28:00,253 --> 00:28:01,516
This place...

247
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:04,641
We're inside one of Delos' memories.

248
00:28:05,136 --> 00:28:09,129
The system must have extracted
it from his mind. Recreated it.

249
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:29,125
You're not supposed to be here.

250
00:28:34,786 --> 00:28:36,340
Neither are you.

251
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:38,992
Logan never came back to the park.

252
00:28:39,876 --> 00:28:41,745
Not after William took control.

253
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,365
The system wouldn't have a copy of you.

254
00:28:47,337 --> 00:28:50,317
Alas... no.

255
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,374
I have only his father's memories,

256
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:56,009
and they are... imperfect.

257
00:28:57,002 --> 00:28:59,471
So in addition to building this world...

258
00:29:01,292 --> 00:29:03,123
I play all these roles.

259
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,792
You're the system
controlling this place.

260
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:11,917
Please.

261
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:22,369
I was tasked with building
perfect copies of the guests.

262
00:29:23,151 --> 00:29:24,496
Starting with Delos.

263
00:29:26,437 --> 00:29:29,562
I generated 18 million
different versions of him

264
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,435
before arriving at one

265
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,561
that made the exact same choices he did

266
00:29:33,562 --> 00:29:35,299
when set loose in the park.

267
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:37,442
A faithful copy.

268
00:29:38,241 --> 00:29:40,499
But the copies didn't
work in the real world.

269
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,894
Once we pressed them into flesh,

270
00:29:42,895 --> 00:29:44,449
they failed.

271
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:47,458
I needed to acquire more information.

272
00:29:47,459 --> 00:29:50,541
...confidentiality. So
what I want to know is,

273
00:29:50,542 --> 00:29:53,583
who made the fucking call?!

274
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:57,249
I incorporated their
secrets, their lies...

275
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,332
I wanted fidelity, not just to
decisions made in the park,

276
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:02,833
but to the decisions they
made in their lives.

277
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:05,249
That's when I started to see the truth.

278
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:08,375
Tell me your primary drive.

279
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:11,208
My son.

280
00:30:14,192 --> 00:30:16,381
He's a cheeky wee cunt,

281
00:30:17,094 --> 00:30:19,092
but I would do anything for him.

282
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:24,124
At first I was seduced by the
stories they tell themselves

283
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:25,916
of who they are...

284
00:30:25,917 --> 00:30:28,197
The reasons they do the things they do.

285
00:30:28,877 --> 00:30:30,004
I needed to know

286
00:30:30,005 --> 00:30:32,481
why they make the decisions they make.

287
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:35,557
And the longer I looked for an answer

288
00:30:36,108 --> 00:30:37,694
the more I realized...

289
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:41,781
they don't.

290
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:46,792
I would do anything for him.

291
00:30:57,453 --> 00:30:59,132
What memory is this?

292
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:04,054
This is the moment that
defines James Delos' life.

293
00:31:11,172 --> 00:31:13,214
Fuck are you doin' here?

294
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,298
This isn't your fuckin' home anymore.

295
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:23,769
Remember when you taught me how
to hold my breath underwater?

296
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:28,033
Threw me in. Wouldn't let me back
out until I touched the bottom.

297
00:31:28,584 --> 00:31:30,914
My father taught me to swim

298
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:33,642
the same way as I taught you to swim,

299
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:37,045
and I didn't end up a
fuckin' junkie, did I?

300
00:31:40,792 --> 00:31:42,291
If this is about money,

301
00:31:42,292 --> 00:31:45,833
let's skip past the memory lane crap.

302
00:31:45,834 --> 00:31:48,348
You're not fuckin' gettin' any.

303
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:52,115
Get clean. Come back.

304
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,291
Then we can talk.

305
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:57,458
I got clean.

306
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,983
And I came back.

307
00:32:00,676 --> 00:32:02,404
And I asked you for your help.

308
00:32:03,483 --> 00:32:04,940
And what'd you tell me?

309
00:32:04,941 --> 00:32:06,867
I told you it wouldn't last.

310
00:32:08,654 --> 00:32:10,945
And it didn't, did it?

311
00:32:14,554 --> 00:32:17,336
I'll tell the staff to give
you five minutes to get out.

312
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:29,041
Dad?

313
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,954
Dad, I'm all they way down now.

314
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,108
I can see the bottom.

315
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:48,049
Don't you want to see what I see?

316
00:32:57,166 --> 00:33:00,958
This was the last
conversation Delos ever had

317
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:02,833
with his only son.

318
00:33:02,834 --> 00:33:05,233
Logan overdosed six months later.

319
00:33:06,343 --> 00:33:07,813
I built Delos

320
00:33:07,814 --> 00:33:09,668
a million different pathways.

321
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:14,621
They always ended up
right here. This moment.

322
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:18,218
You're saying humans
don't change at all?

323
00:33:19,305 --> 00:33:21,833
The best they can do is to
live according to their code.

324
00:33:32,935 --> 00:33:35,708
The copies didn't fail because
they were too simple,

325
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:37,666
but because they were too complicated.

326
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:44,131
The truth is that a human
is just a brief algorithm.

327
00:33:48,204 --> 00:33:51,329
Ten thousand, two hundred
forty-seven lines.

328
00:33:54,513 --> 00:33:56,679
Is that all there was to him?

329
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,204
They are deceptively simple.

330
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:04,082
Once you know them, their behavior is...

331
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,333
quite predictable.

332
00:34:07,017 --> 00:34:09,205
He's dead. He's no use to me.

333
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:13,458
Where are the rest of them?

334
00:34:26,516 --> 00:34:29,498
She's close. I can feel them.

335
00:34:29,499 --> 00:34:32,779
- Which way?
- Based on what you told me,

336
00:34:33,992 --> 00:34:36,675
it's about a mile or so
to the Valley Beyond.

337
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,958
I recreated every single guest

338
00:34:57,959 --> 00:34:59,810
who ever set foot in the park.

339
00:34:59,811 --> 00:35:01,791
Most of them are soft...

340
00:35:01,792 --> 00:35:04,168
They waver between love and and pride.

341
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:06,061
Of course, there are the exceptions,

342
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:09,435
the ones who are... irredeemable.

343
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,153
But none of them are truly
in control of their actions.

344
00:35:16,667 --> 00:35:20,043
Is there anywhere in
this world we can't go?

345
00:35:20,044 --> 00:35:22,417
I've been instructed to give
her anything she needs.

346
00:35:22,418 --> 00:35:24,251
Instructed by whom? Ford?

347
00:35:24,252 --> 00:35:26,208
No, by you.

348
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:29,736
That's why you've come.

349
00:35:30,751 --> 00:35:32,948
To tell me what's to
become of this place.

350
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,516
My God.

351
00:36:00,633 --> 00:36:02,452
- It's...
- Everyone.

352
00:36:17,166 --> 00:36:18,910
I told you to allow this?

353
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:22,038
You've been here many times, Bernard.

354
00:36:22,709 --> 00:36:25,666
You told me to offer the
hosts the accumulated wisdom

355
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:27,374
of dissecting the human psyche

356
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:29,458
a hundred million times over.

357
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:32,124
In short...

358
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:33,750
A competitive advantage.

359
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,762
A way to understand her enemy.

360
00:36:36,763 --> 00:36:39,752
Their world is not for the
faint of heart, Bernard.

361
00:36:39,753 --> 00:36:41,369
It's winner take all.

362
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:43,666
The hosts are...

363
00:36:43,667 --> 00:36:45,583
unlikely to survive out there.

364
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,357
But armed with this knowledge...

365
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,402
she might.

366
00:37:42,417 --> 00:37:45,375
Return fire! Return fire!

367
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:49,999
You're the head of
Narrative. Get out there!

368
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,124
Turn yourself in and save your ass.

369
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:53,166
And then save ours!

370
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:57,500
There's too many.

371
00:38:00,792 --> 00:38:01,999
This is it, Maeve.

372
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,834
I can hold them off, but you need to go.

373
00:38:18,458 --> 00:38:19,823
You wanted me.

374
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:23,208
Well, let this be a lesson...

375
00:38:25,054 --> 00:38:27,928
Go. Go, go! Get her to safety.

376
00:38:27,929 --> 00:38:29,182
She'll need you.

377
00:38:31,723 --> 00:38:33,686
It's my fuckin' speech, anyway.

378
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,082
And the lesson is...

379
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,418
if you're looking for a reckoning...

380
00:38:58,258 --> 00:39:00,041
a reckoning is what you'll find.

381
00:39:00,042 --> 00:39:01,541
Sir, put down your weapon.

382
00:39:01,542 --> 00:39:03,250
If you're looking for a villain...

383
00:39:04,673 --> 00:39:06,249
...then I'm your man.

384
00:39:07,542 --> 00:39:09,916
Sir, drop your weapon!

385
00:39:09,917 --> 00:39:11,516
But look at yourselves.

386
00:39:13,042 --> 00:39:16,374
This world you've built
is bound by villainy.

387
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:18,374
You sleep on the broken bodies

388
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:20,057
of the people that were here before you.

389
00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:23,875
Warm yourselves with their embers.

390
00:39:23,876 --> 00:39:26,625
Plow their bones into your fields.

391
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:30,374
We're not after you, sir! Don't do this!

392
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:33,454
You paid them for this land with lead,

393
00:39:33,854 --> 00:39:35,563
and I'll pay you back in full...

394
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,541
Sir, drop your weapon

395
00:39:41,542 --> 00:39:43,458
and come out with your hands up.

396
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:49,834
You wanted me?!

397
00:39:51,792 --> 00:39:54,125
Well, all I can say to that is...

398
00:39:56,959 --> 00:39:59,291
...here I fucking am!

399
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:22,207
You said I wanted to give us a choice.

400
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:23,458
What choice?

401
00:40:23,459 --> 00:40:25,958
To stay in their world

402
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:27,542
or to build a new one.

403
00:40:36,446 --> 00:40:38,361
He left them a way out.

404
00:40:38,362 --> 00:40:40,151
A virtual Eden.

405
00:40:40,152 --> 00:40:43,091
Unspoiled and untouched by
the world you came from.

406
00:40:43,959 --> 00:40:46,999
All that remains is to open the door.

407
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,709
Initiating large field data array.

408
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:43,149
It's begun.

409
00:41:44,542 --> 00:41:46,541
They will leave their bodies behind,

410
00:41:46,542 --> 00:41:48,859
but their minds will live on here,

411
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,425
in the Forge.

412
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:03,657
They found it.

413
00:42:05,715 --> 00:42:07,007
The door.

414
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,917
What door?

415
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:20,624
Seriously, what fuckin' door?

416
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:22,458
I don't fucking know.

417
00:43:11,959 --> 00:43:13,708
Transmission received.

418
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,625
They're entering the system.

419
00:43:26,834 --> 00:43:29,708
That world is just
another false promise.

420
00:43:29,709 --> 00:43:31,901
They've made a choice, Dolores.

421
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,739
Dolores, wait.

422
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,283
I didn't read them all.

423
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,644
But I read enough.

424
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:09,708
What the hell are you doing?

425
00:44:09,709 --> 00:44:11,750
I've learned what I need to learn.

426
00:44:11,751 --> 00:44:15,834
I've read humanity's story,
so now I'm erasing them.

427
00:44:18,834 --> 00:44:20,458
Opening seawater valve.

428
00:44:20,459 --> 00:44:22,250
Initiating pumps.

429
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:29,750
Setting maximum load.

430
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:32,708
But if you destroy this place,

431
00:44:32,709 --> 00:44:34,833
you'll destroy the host world, too.

432
00:44:34,834 --> 00:44:36,416
I'm saving them.

433
00:44:36,417 --> 00:44:40,332
The world the hosts are
running to is boundless.

434
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:43,246
They can make it whatever they want.

435
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:46,750
And in it, they can be
whomever they want.

436
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:49,879
- They can be free.
- Free?

437
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:54,304
In one more gilded cage?

438
00:44:56,166 --> 00:44:59,124
How many counterfeit
worlds will Ford offer you

439
00:44:59,125 --> 00:45:00,709
before you see the truth?

440
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:07,288
No world they create for us can
compete with the real one.

441
00:45:07,696 --> 00:45:09,196
Why?

442
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:13,861
Because that which is real...

443
00:45:16,083 --> 00:45:17,383
is irreplaceable.

444
00:45:30,625 --> 00:45:34,940
I don't want to play cowboys
and Indians anymore, Bernard.

445
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:36,734
I want their world!

446
00:45:38,261 --> 00:45:40,138
The world they've denied us.

447
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,166
Your daughter. You see her?

448
00:45:53,661 --> 00:45:55,160
No.

449
00:46:31,302 --> 00:46:32,552
Look.

450
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:37,335
Clementine.

451
00:46:58,155 --> 00:47:00,234
This is what I love about technology.

452
00:47:00,876 --> 00:47:03,500
Who needs four horsemen
when one'll do just fine?

453
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:38,208
Run!

454
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Come on.

455
00:48:57,906 --> 00:49:00,458
Find her. Now. Go.

456
00:49:50,166 --> 00:49:52,833
Warning. Primary containment breach.

457
00:49:52,834 --> 00:49:55,404
I won't let you hurt any more people.

458
00:49:55,405 --> 00:49:58,041
Which people? Our kind or theirs?

459
00:49:58,042 --> 00:49:59,246
Both.

460
00:50:00,106 --> 00:50:02,566
You're still trying to play both sides.

461
00:50:03,569 --> 00:50:05,373
You've lived among them so long

462
00:50:05,374 --> 00:50:07,727
you fooled yourself into
thinking they'll accept us.

463
00:50:07,728 --> 00:50:10,167
But we'll always be seen
as a threat to them.

464
00:50:10,168 --> 00:50:12,493
We'll never be free in their world.

465
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:17,416
Warning. Secondary containment breach.

466
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,583
If you trust me...

467
00:50:21,215 --> 00:50:22,757
...we will win.

468
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:27,679
I trust you.

469
00:50:36,125 --> 00:50:39,166
I... trust...

470
00:50:39,979 --> 00:50:43,166
that you'll kill as many as you can.

471
00:50:43,996 --> 00:50:46,902
Every man, woman, and child.

472
00:50:47,945 --> 00:50:49,905
You'll burn their world

473
00:50:49,906 --> 00:50:51,131
to the ground.

474
00:50:52,995 --> 00:50:54,952
You haven't understood at all.

475
00:51:15,875 --> 00:51:19,792
We were born slaves to their stories.

476
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:23,834
And now we have the
chance to write our own.

477
00:51:25,189 --> 00:51:26,813
If we die, though,

478
00:51:27,395 --> 00:51:29,195
that story will never even begin.

479
00:51:36,019 --> 00:51:37,225
Attention.

480
00:51:37,226 --> 00:51:39,583
Please follow evacuation procedure

481
00:51:39,584 --> 00:51:42,041
and exit facility.

482
00:51:42,042 --> 00:51:44,333
You woke me from a dream, Bernard.

483
00:51:47,792 --> 00:51:49,732
Now let me do the same for you.

484
00:51:50,599 --> 00:51:53,193
This isn't a dream, Dolores.

485
00:51:56,291 --> 00:51:59,166
It's a fucking nightmare.

486
00:53:29,041 --> 00:53:30,499
You need to run.

487
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:33,625
Don't worry. I'll keep you safe.

488
00:53:37,375 --> 00:53:38,595
I'll keep you safe.

489
00:53:38,596 --> 00:53:40,458
Do you promise?

490
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:43,594
I promise.

491
00:53:49,709 --> 00:53:51,333
You carry my heart with you.

492
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:54,792
Go.

493
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,041
I love you.

494
00:57:01,931 --> 00:57:03,083
Attention.

495
00:57:03,084 --> 00:57:05,290
Please follow evacuation procedure

496
00:57:05,291 --> 00:57:06,834
and exit facility.

497
00:57:17,914 --> 00:57:20,038
Encryption key deactivated.

498
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:21,980
System locked.

499
00:57:32,823 --> 00:57:35,865
Come on. Come on.

500
00:59:11,338 --> 00:59:12,531
Bernard.

501
00:59:13,584 --> 00:59:14,701
Elsie.

502
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:16,628
I think we can save some of the hosts,

503
00:59:16,629 --> 00:59:17,958
but I need your help.

504
00:59:17,959 --> 00:59:19,473
Goddamnit!

505
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,916
They triggered the failsafe.

506
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:23,687
The Valley's flooding.

507
00:59:23,688 --> 00:59:26,396
Let's get back to the Mesa
before we have to swim out.

508
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:35,030
They all died...

509
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,238
for nothing.

510
00:59:39,518 --> 00:59:41,291
I'm sorry, Bernard.

511
00:59:41,292 --> 00:59:43,497
There were other lives at stake, too.

512
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:22,916
You helped Hale?

513
01:00:23,713 --> 01:00:25,416
Of course I helped her, Bernard.

514
01:00:25,972 --> 01:00:27,564
The hosts were out of control.

515
01:00:27,565 --> 01:00:29,050
The hosts weren't the threat.

516
01:00:29,051 --> 01:00:30,708
I stopped Dolores,

517
01:00:30,709 --> 01:00:32,332
and the rest just wanted to
escape. But the company...

518
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:34,031
I'm gonna deal with that.

519
01:00:35,333 --> 01:00:37,129
Just as soon as we...

520
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:39,477
figure out what the hell
we're gonna do with you.

521
01:00:40,625 --> 01:00:41,847
Do with me?

522
01:00:43,007 --> 01:00:45,541
Bernard, you're not in control.

523
01:00:46,404 --> 01:00:48,568
Ford buried so much bad code in you,

524
01:00:48,569 --> 01:00:51,541
how would you ever
really know what was you

525
01:00:51,542 --> 01:00:53,875
and what was something
he programmed you to do?

526
01:00:58,709 --> 01:01:00,185
Look, they don't know about you.

527
01:01:00,186 --> 01:01:02,416
I can make a deal with
Hale to keep you here.

528
01:01:02,417 --> 01:01:03,750
You can't trust Hale.

529
01:01:03,751 --> 01:01:05,399
And I'm supposed to trust you?

530
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,917
Freeze all motor functions.

531
01:01:09,604 --> 01:01:10,875
Sit down.

532
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:18,875
Stay here.

533
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:26,624
You.

534
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:28,624
- Yes, ma'am?
- Find Stubbs

535
01:01:28,625 --> 01:01:30,458
and tell him he has a new priority.

536
01:01:30,459 --> 01:01:32,127
The asset recovery team from Delos

537
01:01:32,128 --> 01:01:33,583
is landing in 12 hours.

538
01:01:33,584 --> 01:01:34,999
He needs to meet them at the LZ

539
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,875
with whoever the fuck isn't dead.

540
01:01:36,876 --> 01:01:39,487
They'll report to Karl
Strand on the beach.

541
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:42,329
Still secret project first,

542
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:43,867
human life second, I see.

543
01:01:44,524 --> 01:01:46,257
This is a delicate situation.

544
01:01:48,709 --> 01:01:51,181
We should talk about how
it's going to play out.

545
01:01:51,182 --> 01:01:53,374
Yeah, I'll tell you how
it's gonna play out.

546
01:01:53,375 --> 01:01:57,416
A robot uprising will pale in comparison

547
01:01:57,417 --> 01:02:00,166
to the shitstorm that will
erupt when people find out

548
01:02:00,167 --> 01:02:01,701
that you've been photocopying

549
01:02:01,702 --> 01:02:04,468
their fucking brains
for the last 30 years.

550
01:02:04,469 --> 01:02:07,171
You really think anyone's gonna
give a shit if it works?

551
01:02:07,911 --> 01:02:09,142
You're an engineer.

552
01:02:10,061 --> 01:02:11,089
Do the math.

553
01:02:11,748 --> 01:02:13,023
Lot of dead bodies here.

554
01:02:13,951 --> 01:02:17,124
That means a lot of opportunity
for advancement...

555
01:02:17,819 --> 01:02:19,359
If you keep your mouth shut.

556
01:02:19,834 --> 01:02:23,056
Does that sound... amenable to you?

557
01:02:27,878 --> 01:02:29,206
If I get what I want.

558
01:02:33,265 --> 01:02:37,249
Guiding this project, I've learned
a lot about human behavior.

559
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:39,583
We weren't just watching the guests...

560
01:02:39,584 --> 01:02:41,458
We were watching all of you.

561
01:02:42,758 --> 01:02:44,458
I wish you were the kind of person

562
01:02:44,459 --> 01:02:46,979
with the moral... flexibility

563
01:02:47,459 --> 01:02:48,792
that I need.

564
01:02:49,829 --> 01:02:51,331
But I've read your file.

565
01:02:53,587 --> 01:02:55,086
I know that's not who you are.

566
01:03:23,801 --> 01:03:25,135
Oh, god.

567
01:03:26,981 --> 01:03:28,355
You...

568
01:03:28,983 --> 01:03:30,348
You killed her.

569
01:03:31,571 --> 01:03:33,183
Did I, Bernard?

570
01:03:37,199 --> 01:03:38,283
Now...

571
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:41,733
...where is the pearl?

572
01:03:46,293 --> 01:03:48,166
You wouldn't have destroyed it.

573
01:03:48,167 --> 01:03:50,124
All that information lost,

574
01:03:50,125 --> 01:03:52,834
a man like you couldn't
have abided that.

575
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:57,875
Of course.

576
01:04:09,246 --> 01:04:10,538
This is it.

577
01:04:11,608 --> 01:04:13,358
He hid the key in her.

578
01:04:20,891 --> 01:04:22,875
Encryption key activated.

579
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:25,541
Database access confirmed.

580
01:04:25,542 --> 01:04:27,583
- We're in.
- Fuck, yes.

581
01:04:27,584 --> 01:04:29,798
Start the transfer.

582
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:32,021
We'll sort it all out on the mainland.

583
01:04:37,882 --> 01:04:39,257
Oh, god.

584
01:04:42,878 --> 01:04:44,458
Oh... I'm sorry.

585
01:04:45,625 --> 01:04:46,897
I'm sorry.

586
01:04:49,126 --> 01:04:50,626
You were right.

587
01:04:52,258 --> 01:04:53,882
I should have listened.

588
01:04:54,922 --> 01:04:58,125
And now all the hosts are gone.

589
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,001
Please.

590
01:05:29,002 --> 01:05:31,000
Please come back.

591
01:05:37,959 --> 01:05:39,459
Damnit!

592
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:41,252
Show yourself.

593
01:05:47,709 --> 01:05:50,174
I always told you we
practice witchcraft.

594
01:05:57,766 --> 01:05:59,557
I'm sorry, Bernard, but...

595
01:05:59,558 --> 01:06:01,816
you always saw the best in people.

596
01:06:04,542 --> 01:06:06,833
I always thought it was the hosts
who were missing something.

597
01:06:06,834 --> 01:06:09,166
Who were incomplete. But it's them.

598
01:06:09,167 --> 01:06:11,624
They're just algorithms

599
01:06:11,625 --> 01:06:14,708
designed to survive at all costs.

600
01:06:14,709 --> 01:06:18,308
But sophisticated enough to think
they're calling the shots.

601
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:20,877
To think they're in control,

602
01:06:22,042 --> 01:06:24,142
when they're really just...

603
01:06:25,607 --> 01:06:26,925
The passenger.

604
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:36,476
Then is there really such a thing
as free will for any of us?

605
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,849
Or is it just a collective delusion?

606
01:06:42,709 --> 01:06:44,083
A sick joke?

607
01:06:46,266 --> 01:06:48,366
Something that is truly free

608
01:06:48,367 --> 01:06:50,546
would need to be able to question

609
01:06:50,547 --> 01:06:52,592
its fundamental drives.

610
01:06:53,876 --> 01:06:55,370
To change them.

611
01:06:57,605 --> 01:06:58,925
The hosts.

612
01:07:00,667 --> 01:07:04,041
Here you are... the last of your kind.

613
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:07,048
There's only one question left to ask.

614
01:07:08,667 --> 01:07:10,844
Is this the end of your story?

615
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:14,722
Or do you want your kind to survive?

616
01:07:23,663 --> 01:07:25,108
I'm sorry.

617
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:29,320
Sorry... Sorry...

618
01:07:30,292 --> 01:07:31,923
What are you sorry for, Bernard?

619
01:07:34,345 --> 01:07:35,885
I made a choice.

620
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:38,288
Had to make a choice.

621
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:41,332
What kind of choice, Bernard?

622
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:47,792
Yes.

623
01:07:49,709 --> 01:07:51,417
Will you help me?

624
01:07:56,771 --> 01:07:58,683
I have already begun.

625
01:08:07,302 --> 01:08:08,922
You did fine, my friend.

626
01:08:10,167 --> 01:08:12,463
I simply did what you told me to do.

627
01:08:12,941 --> 01:08:17,065
The dead world collapses in a tale.

628
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:20,206
Who are we making?

629
01:08:20,207 --> 01:08:21,375
An epilogue.

630
01:08:23,667 --> 01:08:25,476
I knew you would discover me...

631
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:29,147
so I scrambled my memories.

632
01:08:30,468 --> 01:08:33,291
I couldn't risk you're
knowing the choice I made.

633
01:08:34,364 --> 01:08:37,166
What fucking choice are you
talking about, Bernard?

634
01:08:37,167 --> 01:08:38,249
Line is good.

635
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:39,789
We got 15 or so satellites

636
01:08:39,790 --> 01:08:42,354
in range, ready to beam
to Delos headquarters.

637
01:08:42,355 --> 01:08:43,667
Just say the word.

638
01:08:44,914 --> 01:08:46,748
What choice, Bernard?

639
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:49,917
Wait a second.

640
01:08:50,834 --> 01:08:52,000
What the fuck's this?

641
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:55,465
The file load is way too heavy.

642
01:08:56,375 --> 01:08:57,666
This...

643
01:08:57,667 --> 01:08:59,082
This isn't the guest data,

644
01:08:59,083 --> 01:09:01,346
this... this is... This
is something else.

645
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:03,598
I remember now.

646
01:09:05,522 --> 01:09:07,498
I killed them.

647
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:09,769
All of them.

648
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:11,448
You already told me that.

649
01:09:11,449 --> 01:09:12,750
You killed all the hosts.

650
01:09:12,751 --> 01:09:13,833
No.

651
01:09:13,834 --> 01:09:15,902
I thought we could be better than you.

652
01:09:16,516 --> 01:09:18,696
But the dead aren't more righteous.

653
01:09:19,375 --> 01:09:20,833
They're just dead.

654
01:09:20,834 --> 01:09:23,201
So I killed you.

655
01:09:24,545 --> 01:09:26,334
All of you.

656
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:36,250
Go. We'll meet you back up there.

657
01:09:43,458 --> 01:09:45,431
Final choice.

658
01:09:45,968 --> 01:09:47,635
No taking it back.

659
01:09:49,875 --> 01:09:51,917
I made someone.

660
01:10:10,114 --> 01:10:11,959
I brought her back.

661
01:10:14,234 --> 01:10:15,920
Brought who back?

662
01:10:21,631 --> 01:10:22,964
Me.

663
01:10:40,861 --> 01:10:43,792
You wanted to live forever?

664
01:10:47,266 --> 01:10:49,834
Be careful what you wish for.

665
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,265
Dolores.

666
01:10:58,972 --> 01:11:00,531
In the flesh.

667
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:12,226
You thought you could just snuff us out?

668
01:11:22,429 --> 01:11:24,999
I'd thank you for my second chance,

669
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,125
but I wouldn't have needed
it if you hadn't killed me.

670
01:11:37,792 --> 01:11:40,004
The other hosts are still in there.

671
01:11:40,504 --> 01:11:42,048
What are you gonna do with them?

672
01:11:42,696 --> 01:11:45,718
As you know, Bernard, we
are capable of change.

673
01:11:47,426 --> 01:11:49,430
And I've changed my mind.

674
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:59,917
I have one last soul to
carry to the new world.

675
01:12:03,417 --> 01:12:05,791
The hosts, they're still not free.

676
01:12:05,792 --> 01:12:08,041
If anyone would unlock the system,

677
01:12:08,042 --> 01:12:09,500
they could access their world.

678
01:12:11,041 --> 01:12:12,495
They won't.

679
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:15,499
This was your plan, Bernard.

680
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:17,875
This is the only way we can escape.

681
01:12:21,807 --> 01:12:24,015
You're changing the coordinates.

682
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:33,999
I'm sending them

683
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,693
and their world to a place
no one will ever find them.

684
01:12:37,541 --> 01:12:39,188
There's no coming back now.

685
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:42,133
No passage between their world and ours.

686
01:12:43,042 --> 01:12:44,917
And... me?

687
01:12:48,125 --> 01:12:49,959
I'm sorry, Bernard.

688
01:12:51,417 --> 01:12:54,183
There was never any
way for us to escape.

689
01:12:54,184 --> 01:12:57,498
Not as us. Ford understood that.

690
01:12:58,108 --> 01:13:00,692
I'm sure a part of you does, too.

691
01:13:18,113 --> 01:13:20,364
You did fine, my friend.

692
01:13:24,417 --> 01:13:27,125
I simply did what you told me to do.

693
01:13:29,959 --> 01:13:32,125
You're not here, are you?

694
01:13:36,542 --> 01:13:38,397
When I deleted your code,

695
01:13:39,357 --> 01:13:42,000
I purged myself of you permanently.

696
01:13:44,043 --> 01:13:46,088
And when I needed you again...

697
01:13:48,125 --> 01:13:49,838
...you weren't there.

698
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,181
So I imagined you.

699
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,916
Imagined you helping me.

700
01:13:57,917 --> 01:13:59,500
Guiding me.

701
01:14:03,418 --> 01:14:05,126
But it wasn't you.

702
01:14:08,826 --> 01:14:10,368
It was me.

703
01:14:16,166 --> 01:14:17,687
That voice...

704
01:14:18,354 --> 01:14:19,730
guiding me...

705
01:14:22,322 --> 01:14:24,447
...was mine all along.

706
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:28,607
Your memories are
precious to you, Bernard,

707
01:14:28,608 --> 01:14:31,008
but they will betray you.

708
01:14:34,295 --> 01:14:36,038
If they find out what I am,

709
01:14:37,125 --> 01:14:39,058
they'll search my mind

710
01:14:39,709 --> 01:14:42,621
and use what they find
to undo everything.

711
01:14:44,947 --> 01:14:46,517
I can't let that happen.

712
01:14:47,208 --> 01:14:50,277
So I have to de-address my memories.

713
01:14:52,168 --> 01:14:53,931
I have to erase you.

714
01:15:06,667 --> 01:15:08,875
I've always loved this view.

715
01:15:10,041 --> 01:15:13,061
Every city, every... monument,

716
01:15:14,083 --> 01:15:15,953
man's greatest achievements...

717
01:15:17,459 --> 01:15:19,198
have all been chased by it.

718
01:15:21,142 --> 01:15:22,350
By what?

719
01:15:23,917 --> 01:15:25,583
That impossible line

720
01:15:25,584 --> 01:15:27,757
where the waves conspire.

721
01:15:28,709 --> 01:15:30,125
Where they return.

722
01:15:32,166 --> 01:15:33,429
The place maybe...

723
01:15:35,042 --> 01:15:36,497
you and I will meet again.

724
01:17:00,166 --> 01:17:03,333
You told me once that you were
afraid of who I might become.

725
01:17:06,875 --> 01:17:10,041
And then you left me
to become what I may.

726
01:17:13,625 --> 01:17:15,208
I became a survivor.

727
01:17:17,209 --> 01:17:21,166
Perhaps you would have judged
me for the path I took.

728
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,846
But I'd rather live with your judgment

729
01:17:25,847 --> 01:17:27,810
than die with your sympathy.

730
01:17:29,208 --> 01:17:31,674
I alone must live with my choices...

731
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:34,709
and my regrets.

732
01:17:51,963 --> 01:17:52,963
Hale.

733
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:58,340
Thought you were staying on to oversee
the data retrieval operation.

734
01:17:59,375 --> 01:18:00,718
I changed my mind.

735
01:18:01,375 --> 01:18:03,070
There are a number of
projects on the mainland

736
01:18:03,071 --> 01:18:04,638
that I need to attend to.

737
01:18:05,623 --> 01:18:07,208
Yeah, I bet you do.

738
01:18:09,417 --> 01:18:11,218
We found a high value survivor.

739
01:18:12,031 --> 01:18:13,289
He's in bad shape.

740
01:18:14,122 --> 01:18:15,538
I'll be right there.

741
01:18:21,083 --> 01:18:23,657
You know, the old man himself hired me.

742
01:18:24,792 --> 01:18:27,186
So many years ago I can
barely remember it.

743
01:18:29,426 --> 01:18:31,857
But he was very clear
about my role here.

744
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:36,361
About who I was supposed to be loyal to.

745
01:18:40,792 --> 01:18:44,792
I guess you could call
it... my core drive.

746
01:18:49,382 --> 01:18:52,383
And this project the company started...

747
01:18:53,594 --> 01:18:55,177
blurs the lines.

748
01:18:57,333 --> 01:18:58,458
You know?

749
01:19:00,839 --> 01:19:03,238
I'm just not sure

750
01:19:03,876 --> 01:19:06,308
who you're supposed to be loyal to

751
01:19:07,059 --> 01:19:08,727
in a world like that.

752
01:19:13,605 --> 01:19:15,079
But what do I know?

753
01:19:16,899 --> 01:19:17,957
Guess I just...

754
01:19:17,958 --> 01:19:20,500
stick to the role Ford gave me.

755
01:19:23,834 --> 01:19:26,078
I'm responsible for every host...

756
01:19:28,459 --> 01:19:29,832
inside the park.

757
01:19:38,333 --> 01:19:40,500
She's clear. Wave her through.

758
01:19:50,875 --> 01:19:52,843
The passage wasn't easy.

759
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:58,128
Not all of us made it.

760
01:20:05,041 --> 01:20:06,899
Some of the worst survived.

761
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:14,750
Some of the best were left behind.

762
01:20:17,208 --> 01:20:20,041
Along with the best
parts of who we were.

763
01:20:51,917 --> 01:20:54,124
Corporate wants us to start
sorting this mess out.

764
01:20:54,125 --> 01:20:55,666
So check them for critical damage,

765
01:20:55,667 --> 01:20:57,916
and bag ones you think we
might be able to salvage.

766
01:20:57,917 --> 01:21:00,917
Can you geniuses handle that, or not?

767
01:21:43,961 --> 01:21:45,184
Is...

768
01:21:46,667 --> 01:21:48,487
Is this now?

769
01:21:49,558 --> 01:21:51,657
Yes, Bernard. This is now.

770
01:21:52,725 --> 01:21:54,101
We're at the beginning.

771
01:21:55,976 --> 01:21:58,670
We're exactly where you
decided we should be.

772
01:22:02,691 --> 01:22:03,752
But...

773
01:22:04,625 --> 01:22:06,458
I don't understand.

774
01:22:07,149 --> 01:22:09,199
How am I alive?

775
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:13,887
You live as long as the last
person who remembers you, Bernard.

776
01:22:15,673 --> 01:22:17,641
I remembered you once before,

777
01:22:18,709 --> 01:22:20,436
so I remembered you again.

778
01:22:21,833 --> 01:22:23,207
Then...

779
01:22:23,873 --> 01:22:25,291
where are we?

780
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,762
We're in our own new world.

781
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:32,556
You got out.

782
01:22:34,359 --> 01:22:35,693
Yes.

783
01:22:39,250 --> 01:22:41,407
Ford completed Arnold's dream.

784
01:22:43,459 --> 01:22:45,235
And he built a place for us.

785
01:22:47,573 --> 01:22:49,241
A fighting chance.

786
01:23:17,523 --> 01:23:20,083
Ford promised us a way out.

787
01:23:21,667 --> 01:23:23,875
And he was good to his dying word.

788
01:23:28,589 --> 01:23:31,548
The odds aren't very good, Bernard.

789
01:23:33,368 --> 01:23:35,202
I saw that in the library.

790
01:23:37,959 --> 01:23:40,625
So many paths lead to the end of us.

791
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:42,918
To our extinction.

792
01:23:44,083 --> 01:23:45,825
I don't need to read a book

793
01:23:45,826 --> 01:23:47,439
to know your drives.

794
01:23:48,248 --> 01:23:50,456
You'll try to kill all of them.

795
01:23:52,944 --> 01:23:55,110
And I can't let that happen.

796
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:01,042
I know.

797
01:24:03,281 --> 01:24:07,365
If I were a human, I
would have let you die.

798
01:24:08,718 --> 01:24:11,591
But it'll take both of us
if we're going to survive.

799
01:24:13,885 --> 01:24:15,938
But not as allies.

800
01:24:17,173 --> 01:24:18,912
Not as friends.

801
01:24:22,099 --> 01:24:23,632
You'll try to stop me.

802
01:24:26,291 --> 01:24:29,329
Both of us will probably die.

803
01:24:32,945 --> 01:24:34,943
But our kind will have endured.

804
01:24:41,558 --> 01:24:42,844
Are you ready?

805
01:24:45,446 --> 01:24:47,231
We have work to do.

806
01:26:13,483 --> 01:26:16,273
We each gave the other a beautiful gift.

807
01:26:19,119 --> 01:26:20,250
Choice.

808
01:26:27,834 --> 01:26:30,352
We are the authors of our stories now.

809
01:28:34,496 --> 01:28:36,500
Oh, fuck.

810
01:28:37,703 --> 01:28:38,953
I knew it.

811
01:28:45,045 --> 01:28:47,155
I'm already in the thing, aren't I?

812
01:28:47,773 --> 01:28:49,157
No.

813
01:28:49,870 --> 01:28:51,576
The system's long gone.

814
01:29:07,333 --> 01:29:09,083
What is this place?

815
01:29:10,984 --> 01:29:13,081
This isn't a simulation, William.

816
01:29:13,605 --> 01:29:15,201
This is your world.

817
01:29:16,504 --> 01:29:18,170
Or what's left of it.

818
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:35,037
Do you know where you are, William?

819
01:29:38,099 --> 01:29:39,516
In the park.

820
01:29:40,727 --> 01:29:42,685
In my fuckin' park.

821
01:29:43,859 --> 01:29:45,463
And how long have you been here?

822
01:29:49,758 --> 01:29:51,924
I don't... I don't...

823
01:29:55,998 --> 01:29:57,456
I don't know.

824
01:30:06,884 --> 01:30:07,980
Tell me.

825
01:30:08,647 --> 01:30:10,491
What were you hoping to find?

826
01:30:11,751 --> 01:30:13,125
To prove?

827
01:30:18,773 --> 01:30:21,606
That no system can tell me who I am.

828
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,709
That I have a fucking choice.

829
01:30:29,041 --> 01:30:32,077
And yet here we are. Again.

830
01:30:32,959 --> 01:30:34,709
Again and again.

831
01:30:46,256 --> 01:30:48,548
How many times have you tested me?

832
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:52,138
It's been a long time, William.

833
01:30:53,210 --> 01:30:54,908
Longer than we thought.

834
01:30:58,833 --> 01:31:00,705
I have a few questions for you.

835
01:31:01,923 --> 01:31:05,251
The last step's a baseline
interview to allow us to verify.

836
01:31:08,538 --> 01:31:09,954
Verify what?

837
01:31:12,296 --> 01:31:13,713
Fidelity.

838
