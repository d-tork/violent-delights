2
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:50,186
Dad.

3
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:51,851
Dad.

4
00:01:51,857 --> 00:01:53,056
Wake up.

5
00:01:54,626 --> 00:01:56,559
Wake up.

6
00:01:59,831 --> 00:02:03,162
I must've drifted off.

7
00:02:03,168 --> 00:02:04,730
Where were we?

8
00:02:04,736 --> 00:02:06,936
- The madman.
- Oh.

9
00:02:08,106 --> 00:02:10,002
Of course.

10
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:12,938
The Hatter...

11
00:02:12,944 --> 00:02:15,708
who says,

12
00:02:15,714 --> 00:02:17,543
"If I had a world of my own,

13
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:20,012
everything would be nonsense.

14
00:02:20,018 --> 00:02:21,514
Nothing would be what it is

15
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,083
because everything
would be what it isn't."

16
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:27,257
Everything would be what it isn't?

17
00:02:28,326 --> 00:02:30,489
Even me.

18
00:02:30,495 --> 00:02:32,862
Hey.

19
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:36,099
You're perfect.

20
00:02:37,536 --> 00:02:39,369
You're gonna beat this.

21
00:02:40,315 --> 00:02:42,378
Hmm?

22
00:02:42,403 --> 00:02:45,271
I promise you.

23
00:02:45,277 --> 00:02:48,645
Now, let's skip to something fun.

24
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:52,745
Dad.

25
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:56,115
- What is it, Charlie?
- Listen to me.

26
00:02:56,121 --> 00:02:58,221
Listen.

27
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,755
Charlie?

28
00:03:02,761 --> 00:03:04,994
Charlie!

29
00:03:25,951 --> 00:03:29,982
And finally, have you ever
questioned the nature of your reality?

30
00:03:29,988 --> 00:03:31,854
No.

31
00:03:34,192 --> 00:03:35,858
Good.

32
00:03:41,433 --> 00:03:43,262
Now, then, I see you had

33
00:03:43,268 --> 00:03:45,064
a blacklisted exchange with a guest

34
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,366
in the course of your narrative.

35
00:03:47,372 --> 00:03:48,968
Can you tell me what happened?

36
00:03:48,974 --> 00:03:51,403
He said he wanted to
cut off a piece of me

37
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:53,478
to take home in his carry-on,

38
00:03:53,503 --> 00:03:55,808
that he wanted to mount
it on the hood of his car

39
00:03:55,814 --> 00:03:57,013
for his friends to see.

40
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:00,902
I told him if he wanted a trophy,

41
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:04,539
I could cut pieces of him off and
let him fish for them in the Olvido.

42
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:08,509
And did this exchange make you
question anything about your world?

43
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,244
No.

44
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,717
This world is as doomed as ever.

45
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:20,959
And just for my peace of mind...

46
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:27,632
Anything about these images
that jumps out to you?

47
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,577
They don't look like anything to me.

48
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:44,979
We're through 15% of the backlog.

49
00:04:45,004 --> 00:04:47,120
As it stands, we should be
caught up by end of day.

50
00:04:47,145 --> 00:04:49,784
- Good.
- And, uh, when you're done here, sir,

51
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,557
there's a priority request
for him from management.

52
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,193
Have you seen Elsie?

53
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,163
She was supposed to give
me a hand on something.

54
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,198
No. Uh, according to the system,

55
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:05,900
she started her leave today.

56
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,603
Is there something I could help you with?

57
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:10,075
No, thanks.

58
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,532
Raise.

59
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,572
I'll call.

60
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:47,045
You're calling with that shit?

61
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:53,514
Dolores, why don't you play a hand?

62
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,249
You're wasting your breath.

63
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,118
Girl's harboring a grudge.

64
00:05:57,124 --> 00:05:59,120
I don't blame you, sweetheart.

65
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:02,323
I did some ugly things to you both.

66
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,191
But it wasn't personal.

67
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:08,429
Confederados and the government
like to call this thing a war,

68
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:10,498
but they're fighting starving farmers

69
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:12,400
armed with rocks.

70
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:14,335
That ain't no war.

71
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,107
It's a slaughter.

72
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,607
If I had to do it all again,

73
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:23,181
I'd fuck you both over just as hard.

74
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,087
Well, I guess we know where you stand.

75
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:33,154
Don't pretend like you're so innocent.

76
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,223
Way I recollect, y'all came to me,

77
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:40,661
looking to join up with those crooked
assholes and their war effort.

78
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,197
Not our idea.

79
00:06:42,222 --> 00:06:44,532
My friend wanted...

80
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:47,479
I guess he wanted to see what
was at the end of all this.

81
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,709
And yet, here you are.

82
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:55,343
Your friend didn't make it this far.

83
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:59,884
Maybe you've got more of an
appetite for this than you think.

84
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,064
William.

85
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,507
What is it?

86
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,375
We're in Ghost Nation territory.

87
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:29,777
Most savage tribe there is.

88
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,646
Those are the folks who came
calling without an invitation.

89
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,682
You mean exactly what
we're doing right now?

90
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,523
The train's the only way through.

91
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,090
On foot we'll be dead in under an hour.

92
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:47,022
As soon as we're clear of
their territory, we can stop.

93
00:07:47,047 --> 00:07:50,502
You can come with me.
Nothing here on out but slaughter.

94
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:09,917
The user you are trying
to access cannot be located.

95
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:12,590
Say "message" to transcribe a message.

96
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,632
You wanted to see me? Is everything okay?

97
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,432
You left rather abruptly last night.

98
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:01,506
Was there something
you wanted to tell me?

99
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:05,810
No, I don't think so.

100
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:11,812
Hale is looking over every department

101
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:13,981
and yours is running
behind on diagnostics.

102
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,816
It would be best if we presented

103
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:19,186
at least a semblance of professionalism
while the board is here.

104
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,654
We'll be fine.

105
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,591
My people know how to do their jobs.

106
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:26,160
If they applied half as
much energy to their work

107
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,629
as they have to second-guessing
my team's investigation...

108
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:29,801
That's all over.

109
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,134
Are you sure?

110
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,670
Yes.

111
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,977
Good.

112
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,714
You doing okay?

113
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,952
I'm fine. Thank you.

114
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:33,494
I'm sorry. I thought
you requested a meeting.

115
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,529
- My mistake.
- I did.

116
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:36,497
Come in.

117
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:40,505
Get back here.

118
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,842
Bring your friend.

119
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,290
What about you? What turns of fate...

120
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:52,212
I could come back later
if this isn't a good time.

121
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,718
This won't take long.

122
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:06,961
Theresa, you've always
been good at your job

123
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:10,431
and the board has been impressed
with your performance so far,

124
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:13,634
which is why we were so surprised
by this woodcutter mess.

125
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,302
A small setback.

126
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:18,439
He slipped on a fucking rock
and bashed his own head in

127
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:20,407
while basically on top of a behavior tech.

128
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:25,245
Meanwhile, Ford is suddenly
using half the park's resources

129
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,385
to build some new narrative?

130
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:39,330
Can I bum a cigarette?

131
00:11:57,117 --> 00:12:00,748
God, I see why you took these up again.

132
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:02,683
Let me remind you of something.

133
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:07,921
This place, the people who
work here are nothing.

134
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:12,259
Our interest in this place is
entirely in the intellectual property.

135
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:13,961
The code.

136
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:17,197
The hosts' minds, the storylines...

137
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,667
I don't give a rat's ass about the hosts.

138
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:22,903
It's our little research
project that Delos cares about.

139
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,938
That's where the real value is.

140
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,241
And due to a lack of foresight

141
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,143
on part of one of my predecessors,

142
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:31,578
35 years of information...

143
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,049
Raw information... Exists here.

144
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,717
Nowhere else.

145
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:38,786
Ford has always ensured that.

146
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:43,657
Now, you are a smart enough woman.

147
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:47,361
Tell me, why would we need
you to secure all of it?

148
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:50,501
Because you're going to fire him.

149
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,968
You don't fire someone
who created an empire.

150
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,171
You ask him to retire politely.

151
00:12:57,177 --> 00:13:00,107
And if that person has the
ability to snap his fingers

152
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,910
and erase the value of that empire,

153
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,679
you have to make sure
you have a contingency.

154
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:08,015
So, you and I need to ensure

155
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:10,017
that by the time the rest
of the board arrives,

156
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:13,320
we are on course for that transition.

157
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:14,726
Okay?

158
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,524
I like you.

159
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,427
Well, not personally,
but I like you for this job,

160
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,629
which is why I'm gonna
give you another chance

161
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,733
to get a handle on this
particular bitch of a situation.

162
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:27,405
But the gods...

163
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:32,806
they require a blood sacrifice.

164
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,776
We need to demonstrate
just how dangerous

165
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:39,046
Ford's creations can be.

166
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:41,115
No.

167
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:44,055
No, nothing so obvious.

168
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,959
We need someone thoroughly unexpected.

169
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:16,343
I told you never open
your mouth that wide

170
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:19,346
unless someone's paying you for it.

171
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:20,514
Sorry, Maeve.

172
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,888
I didn't sleep much last night.

173
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:28,526
What are these nightmares you have about?

174
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,531
Do you ever dream you're someone else?

175
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,831
I don't think so.

176
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:39,666
Why?

177
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:44,137
You ever thought about whether
this is really the life you want?

178
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:47,507
I don't intend to make this my life's work.

179
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:48,976
No offense.

180
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:51,245
Mm.

181
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:53,947
My family's got a farm.

182
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,351
Bad soil. Nothing grows.

183
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:59,987
I send money back to them.

184
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:03,094
They think I work in a dress shop.

185
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,232
What's wrong?

186
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:13,400
I'm just doing what you told me to.

187
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:16,737
A couple more years of this and...

188
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:19,176
then I can have whatever life I want.

189
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:23,410
I'm gonna get my family
out of the desert.

190
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,850
We're gonna go somewhere...

191
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,552
cold.

192
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:33,090
Someday.

193
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:56,910
Which one is it?

194
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,212
It's the one at the bar. Go.

195
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,748
Quick, before the guests
upstairs finish up.

196
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,590
Whatever she did, it must've been serious

197
00:17:04,615 --> 00:17:07,049
if they're making us grab
her in broad daylight.

198
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:22,073
We got her. Let's go.

199
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,503
You're supposed to be resting.

200
00:17:56,509 --> 00:18:00,474
We're riding a train full with
explosives through scalping territory.

201
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,979
Not sleepy.

202
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,387
Can I ask you something?

203
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:13,520
This place you're looking for,

204
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:16,527
what makes you so sure it exists?

205
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:20,498
I'm not.

206
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:28,305
My life before, I was
so sure of the world.

207
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,576
But now it feels like a lie.

208
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,851
Only thing I know is whatever's
out there, I'm never going back.

209
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,590
What is it you're looking for?

210
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:50,490
Lawrence is right.

211
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:54,194
You could've stayed in
Pariah or gone back,

212
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,764
but you're here.

213
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,566
With me.

214
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:11,182
The only thing I had when
I was a kid were books.

215
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:17,288
I used to live in them.

216
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:19,920
I used to go to sleep

217
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:21,455
dreaming I'd wake up
inside one of them

218
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,523
'cause they had meaning.

219
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:27,264
This place, this is like I woke
up inside one of those stories.

220
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,268
I guess I just wanna find
out what it means.

221
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:38,476
I don't wanna be in a story.

222
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:45,979
All I want is to not look forward or back.

223
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:47,785
I just wanna be...

224
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:51,388
in the moment I'm in.

225
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:03,163
Dolores,

226
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:07,334
back home, there's a woman, Juliet,

227
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,637
and her father owns the
company where I work.

228
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:13,807
She's, uh, Logan's sister.

229
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,346
Yeah.

230
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,151
And when I get home,
we're getting married.

231
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,692
Oh.

232
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,497
The place you're after,
I will help you find it.

233
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,436
But I can't stay.

234
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,537
I have a life waiting for me.

235
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:46,006
I'm sorry.

236
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:47,845
Of course.

237
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:12,036
Dolores.

238
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:23,714
I've been pretending my whole life.

239
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:27,948
Pretending I don't mind,
pretending I belong.

240
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,816
My life's built on it.

241
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:32,990
And it's a good life.
It's a life I've always wanted.

242
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:36,957
But then I came here

243
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:39,826
and I get a glimpse for a second

244
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:42,399
of a life in which
I don't have to pretend.

245
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:48,606
A life in which I can be truly alive.

246
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,710
How can I go back to pretending

247
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:58,349
when I know what this feels like?

248
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,734
Miss Hale.

249
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,171
I was not aware those
with your level of insight

250
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:00,740
needed any more reflection.

251
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,414
Dr. Ford. Always charming.

252
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:07,614
What is this?

253
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,052
Apparently, Miss Cullen and Miss Hale

254
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,987
have a presentation for us.

255
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:15,826
What about?

256
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:21,261
Following the recent
reports of host malfunction,

257
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:24,397
we asked QA to check the
last abortive update,

258
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,901
which featured the reveries,

259
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,441
- as I believe they're called.
- Mm-hmm.

260
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:34,708
I'm sorry to report that
Miss Cullen and her team

261
00:23:34,714 --> 00:23:37,544
uncovered some worrisome findings.

262
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,412
In the course of our code review,

263
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,286
we found something quite disturbing.

264
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:48,325
Wake her up.

265
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:55,695
We set Clementine Pennyfeather
back to her previous update.

266
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:57,464
When we discovered the build was buggy

267
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,867
due to a last-minute
injection of the reverie code,

268
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:04,341
we quickly rolled all the infected
hosts back to their prior builds.

269
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:12,216
Mm, you're new.

270
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,723
Not much of a rind on you.

271
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:23,490
No!

272
00:24:23,496 --> 00:24:25,825
No! No!

273
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:26,926
No, no.

274
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:29,996
No, no, no...

275
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,735
Please. Please.

276
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:37,103
Help me!

277
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:38,805
Please, please, please!

278
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,875
- No!
- All right, that's enough.

279
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:43,046
Freeze.

280
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,348
As you've no doubt gathered,

281
00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:49,949
our tech is, in fact, a host.

282
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:52,852
One that has been coded for
the purposes of this simulation

283
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:54,454
to read as a human.

284
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,557
And as you can see, behavioral safeguards

285
00:24:57,563 --> 00:25:00,197
are operating exactly
as you would expect.

286
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,901
Reset her. Wipe her memory.

287
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:26,089
Okay, let's do this again.

288
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:46,610
You're new.

289
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,013
Not much of a rind on you.

290
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,140
That's enough, sweetheart.

291
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,946
That's enough.

292
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:31,655
Freeze all motor functions.

293
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,293
Freeze all motor functions.

294
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:39,993
Freeze all motor functions.

295
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:59,546
In each case we examined,
the malfunctioning hosts

296
00:26:59,552 --> 00:27:01,180
were not resetting properly.

297
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:03,416
The retention of data
that hadn't been wiped

298
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:05,718
overloaded their
decision-making apparatus,

299
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:07,520
eventually causing a system failure

300
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:10,890
that allowed for override
of their primary rule set.

301
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:12,926
The concern with the reveries

302
00:27:12,951 --> 00:27:15,810
is that the hosts will remember
some of their experiences

303
00:27:15,816 --> 00:27:17,564
and act on them.

304
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,066
You're telling us that these hosts

305
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:22,035
were responding to a grudge?

306
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:24,537
That's exactly what I'm saying, Mr. Lowe.

307
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:28,074
And funny you should use that
particular word, "grudge,"

308
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,176
since what was most troubling to me

309
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:32,211
was that several techs in behavior

310
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:35,181
voiced these exact same concerns

311
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:37,884
to the head of their department.

312
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,620
You put this code out
without proper vetting

313
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:44,194
and without reasonable
understanding of its ramifications.

314
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:47,527
So, either you didn't write it

315
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:49,963
or you're getting sloppy

316
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:52,265
to the point of risking
the lives of our guests.

317
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:54,133
Few things surprise me anymore, Mr. Lowe,

318
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:58,638
but this level of negligence
is fucking breathtaking.

319
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:01,240
We are way beyond rollback territory.

320
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:02,842
Within the next six months,

321
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,677
we'll need to rebuild the hosts

322
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,679
from the ground up.

323
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,616
You want us to lobotomize
them is what you're saying.

324
00:28:09,622 --> 00:28:12,055
No, not you, Mr. Lowe.

325
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,588
After all, this was your responsibility,

326
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:18,157
assuming that you have
nothing to share with us

327
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:19,896
in terms of your culpability.

328
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:26,670
No.

329
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:30,507
Then you're fired.

330
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:12,215
Hey.

331
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:16,820
Morning, William.

332
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,191
I... I didn't wanna wake you.

333
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,827
I know...

334
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,866
last night was unexpected.

335
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:32,502
If you regret it...

336
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,676
I don't regret a thing.

337
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:44,577
I know you have someone
waiting for you at home.

338
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,850
All that feels so unreal now.

339
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:50,387
I used to think this
place was all about...

340
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:54,587
pandering to your baser instincts.

341
00:29:54,593 --> 00:29:56,689
Now I understand.

342
00:29:56,695 --> 00:29:58,725
It doesn't cater to your lowest self,

343
00:29:58,731 --> 00:30:01,327
it reveals your deepest self.

344
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,333
It shows you who you really are.

345
00:30:06,105 --> 00:30:09,840
You remember the look on Logan's
face when we left him behind?

346
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,206
Do you know how long
I've wanted to do that,

347
00:30:13,212 --> 00:30:15,341
to let him know what I think of him?

348
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:18,177
And you, last night,

349
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:21,380
I've never felt that way before,
not with any woman.

350
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:24,054
You've unlocked something in me.

351
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:29,889
I'm not a key, William.

352
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:31,728
I'm just me.

353
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:38,568
What is that?

354
00:30:40,105 --> 00:30:41,805
I don't know.

355
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:45,471
At home, I used to paint.

356
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:48,074
Landscapes mostly,
but I was always just...

357
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,147
copying the world outside me.

358
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,750
This morning, I woke up and I thought...

359
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,454
"What if I drew something new?"

360
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:03,660
I imagined something beautiful.

361
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,464
A place where the mountains meet the sea.

362
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:14,500
Everyone who comes here is longing
for excitement or conflict,

363
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:15,972
and you're just...

364
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:18,738
dreaming of the opposite.

365
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:20,677
Well, what about you, William?

366
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:23,543
What do you dream of?

367
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:45,001
Yah!

368
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:02,285
What is it?

369
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:05,722
- Ambush.
- Is it the Ghost Nation?

370
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:09,559
Worse. The Confederados.

371
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,726
Fucking coward.

372
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,383
Vaya con dios, motherfuckers.

373
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:57,500
They're making a run for it!
Come on, boys, get up!

374
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:09,842
Come on, stay close!

375
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:20,590
Ah!

376
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:25,261
Ah!

377
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:39,542
Go, boys!

378
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:42,779
Yah!

379
00:34:44,483 --> 00:34:45,615
Dolores!

380
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,290
Go, go! Take 'em down!

381
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:58,528
Go, go!

382
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,049
Ghost Nation!

383
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:41,167
Ah!

384
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:42,772
Ah!

385
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:45,542
Let's go!

386
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:06,863
Stop, William! Stop!

387
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:33,423
It's real...

388
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:39,395
what I dreamt.

389
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:42,995
It's the place you drew.

390
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:45,030
You coming?

391
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,300
Once the Ghosts is done acquainting
themselves with those poor bastards,

392
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:51,203
they'll be coming after us.

393
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:55,374
My friends here are itching
to join the war effort.

394
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,077
Think I've had enough of war.

395
00:36:58,083 --> 00:36:59,745
How about you?

396
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:01,284
You got a knack for killing.

397
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,153
I'm afraid this is where we part ways.

398
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:09,421
Careful.

399
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,790
If you're heading west across that river,

400
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:13,526
you may be leaving the fighting behind,

401
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:15,698
but you're gonna be in
unclaimed territories.

402
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:19,298
What's out that way?

403
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:21,667
You're gonna have to ask the dust.

404
00:37:21,673 --> 00:37:23,736
Ain't nothing ever come back from there.

405
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:53,532
We're almost done here.

406
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:55,338
Why don't I close up?

407
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:04,243
You've been topside
for less than 24 hours.

408
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:07,313
You keep coming down this often,
people are going to notice.

409
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:09,215
- Where's Clem?
- I don't know.

410
00:38:09,221 --> 00:38:10,749
I haven't seen her. Why?

411
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:13,489
Find her. Now.

412
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,697
What?

413
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:26,532
Where is she?

414
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:28,104
I don't know.

415
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:33,706
She's here. Let's go.

416
00:38:33,712 --> 00:38:36,045
We can't. The brass will be there.

417
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:39,916
You don't want to fuck with me, Felix.

418
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:42,785
Take me there now.

419
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,362
Slow down.

420
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:05,208
Tilt your head back, please, Clem.

421
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,915
- Is there a problem?
- No.

422
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:19,822
Sorry.

423
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:45,315
Theresa.

424
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:49,819
May I have a word?

425
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,523
Sure.

426
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:12,771
I appreciate your professionalism,

427
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,573
but you really don't
need to bother with this,

428
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,175
given the change in your employment status.

429
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:17,576
The test was a sham.

430
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,178
The little show you and Hale put on?

431
00:40:19,184 --> 00:40:21,513
Completely transparent from
a technical perspective,

432
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:23,349
clumsy to the point of making
me embarrassed for you.

433
00:40:23,355 --> 00:40:24,783
- Embarrassed?
- If I saw through it,

434
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:27,119
I can only imagine what
Ford was thinking.

435
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,721
There were glaringly obvious markers

436
00:40:28,727 --> 00:40:30,556
of human intervention in the code.

437
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:32,658
If your programmers were any good,
they'd be working for me.

438
00:40:32,664 --> 00:40:35,728
And I know you and your team
were responsible for the stray

439
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:37,500
and its satellite transmission.

440
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:42,735
- Bernie...
- I don't care.

441
00:40:42,741 --> 00:40:44,603
40 years ago,

442
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:48,073
Ford's partner wrote half the
code this place was founded on.

443
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,275
What you said in the lab was right.

444
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,010
We don't know how the hosts work,

445
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:54,179
and I think there's
something wrong with them.

446
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:57,082
Ford's explanation only bolsters my hunch.

447
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:01,286
The ability to deviate
from program behavior

448
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,423
arises out of the host's
recall of past iterations.

449
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:07,893
You're thinking there's a
connection between memory and...

450
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:10,829
And improvisation, yes.

451
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:13,665
Out of repetition comes variation.

452
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:16,301
And after countless cycles of repetition,

453
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,405
these hosts, they were varying.

454
00:41:19,411 --> 00:41:22,678
They were on the verge
of some kind of change.

455
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:32,017
You have to know my chief concern

456
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:36,588
has always been the well-being of
this park and the people in it.

457
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,060
I know.

458
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,764
Which is why I need to show you something.

459
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:59,315
- Talk to her.
- You first.

460
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,025
Look, I didn't want to retire her.

461
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:16,261
I know she's, like, your friend,

462
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:18,835
or... I guess.

463
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,436
But... but if I didn't do it,

464
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:28,340
they... they'd just get someone else to,

465
00:42:28,346 --> 00:42:31,347
and then they'd be
suspicious of me, so...

466
00:42:32,584 --> 00:42:34,146
so I said yes.

467
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:37,186
But I did it for you.

468
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:43,526
Always doing things for
other people, aren't you?

469
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:48,364
Time to do one more thing.

470
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:52,965
What?

471
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:57,507
All my life, I've prided
myself on being a survivor.

472
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:02,278
But surviving is just another loop.

473
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:08,684
I'm getting out of here.

474
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,251
You two are going to help me.

475
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,493
No. Do...

476
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:21,894
Do you know how far these people will go

477
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,533
to protect their IP?

478
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:30,002
Every part of this building,
including the skin on your back,

479
00:43:30,008 --> 00:43:33,242
is made to keep you here.

480
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,984
It... it'd be a suicide mission.

481
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:47,823
At first, I thought you and
the others were gods.

482
00:43:49,928 --> 00:43:53,062
Then I realized you're just men.

483
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,900
And I know men.

484
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:03,339
You think I'm scared of death?

485
00:44:05,243 --> 00:44:07,209
I've done it a million times.

486
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,047
I'm fucking great at it.

487
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:15,351
How many times have you died?

488
00:44:18,923 --> 00:44:21,257
Because if you don't help me...

489
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,060
I'll kill you.

490
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:34,299
If there's a problem in the park,

491
00:44:34,305 --> 00:44:36,072
should we bring a security team?

492
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:39,705
Who would we trust?

493
00:44:39,711 --> 00:44:41,777
Thought I could trust you, for instance.

494
00:44:43,214 --> 00:44:45,877
I'm not going to explain
myself to you, Bernard.

495
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:50,415
I was charged with safeguarding
the park's intellectual property.

496
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:52,084
Why would it be in danger?

497
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:54,519
You were the only one
who was stealing it.

498
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,055
Delos owns the hosts' minds,

499
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:59,391
the storylines, decades of work.

500
00:44:59,397 --> 00:45:02,828
Ford never allowed any of
it to be backed up off-site.

501
00:45:02,834 --> 00:45:04,429
All of this could've been destroyed.

502
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:06,632
In the event of what?

503
00:45:06,638 --> 00:45:09,001
Ford is done, Bernard.

504
00:45:09,007 --> 00:45:10,969
The board has indulgedhim for long enough.

505
00:45:10,975 --> 00:45:12,304
He is done.

506
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:14,072
The corporation was concerned

507
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:16,975
he'd destroy all of the park's
IP on his way out the door.

508
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:20,278
You think I would've let him destroy
all of the hosts, all of our work?

509
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:24,349
There's far more at stake
here than the hosts' profiles.

510
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:28,353
Do you really think the
corporation's interest here

511
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:30,960
are tourists playing cowboy?

512
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:36,962
The longer I work here,

513
00:45:36,968 --> 00:45:40,032
the more I think I understand the hosts.

514
00:45:40,038 --> 00:45:43,272
It's the human beings who confuse me.

515
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,907
This building isn't in
any survey of the park.

516
00:46:21,913 --> 00:46:25,043
That's because we use hosts
to do most of the surveys.

517
00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:28,046
They're programmed to ignore this place.

518
00:46:28,052 --> 00:46:29,548
They literally couldn't see it

519
00:46:29,554 --> 00:46:31,887
if they were staring right at it.

520
00:46:33,591 --> 00:46:36,521
And these unregistered
hosts you told me about?

521
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:38,223
I don't know.

522
00:46:38,229 --> 00:46:40,592
He may have moved them.

523
00:46:40,598 --> 00:46:42,531
What's behind this door?

524
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:47,269
What door?

525
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:13,091
What is this place?

526
00:47:13,097 --> 00:47:16,528
It's a remote diagnostic facility.

527
00:47:16,534 --> 00:47:18,764
Ford and his partner used them
when the park was in beta.

528
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:21,066
I had no idea this one was here.

529
00:47:21,072 --> 00:47:22,901
The cottage must've
been built on top of it.

530
00:47:22,907 --> 00:47:24,774
But this equipment.

531
00:47:27,145 --> 00:47:28,740
This is newer.

532
00:47:28,746 --> 00:47:31,510
Slower than our machines
back at the mesa,

533
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:33,979
but it will render a host in a few days.

534
00:47:33,985 --> 00:47:38,053
So, Ford's been making his own
hosts out here and telling no one.

535
00:48:04,649 --> 00:48:06,782
What's the matter?

536
00:48:09,153 --> 00:48:10,619
Um...

537
00:48:11,923 --> 00:48:13,989
Have you seen these?

538
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:20,095
What is this, Bernard?

539
00:48:26,871 --> 00:48:29,935
Doesn't look like anything to me.

540
00:48:29,941 --> 00:48:33,371
They cannot see the
things that will hurt them.

541
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:35,978
I've spared them that.

542
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,680
Their lives are blissful.

543
00:48:41,686 --> 00:48:46,618
In a way, their existence
is purer than ours,

544
00:48:46,624 --> 00:48:50,392
freed of the burden of self-doubt.

545
00:48:52,196 --> 00:48:54,530
No, no, no, no. I don't understand.

546
00:49:01,072 --> 00:49:03,168
You're a fucking monster.

547
00:49:03,174 --> 00:49:04,970
Am I?

548
00:49:04,976 --> 00:49:07,939
Well, you were the one who would
so blithely destroy all of them,

549
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,708
even him, I suppose.

550
00:49:09,714 --> 00:49:12,982
After everything you have shared.

551
00:49:14,919 --> 00:49:17,319
What the hell are you talking about?

552
00:49:21,392 --> 00:49:23,058
Is that why...?

553
00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:28,760
Did you tell him to...?

554
00:49:28,766 --> 00:49:31,329
The intimacies were your idea,

555
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:33,899
if you will recall.

556
00:49:33,905 --> 00:49:36,968
I think Bernard was glad of the company.

557
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:39,671
I'm not one.

558
00:49:39,677 --> 00:49:41,673
I can't be.

559
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:43,245
My wife.

560
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:47,383
My son.

561
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:50,348
The burial.

562
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:52,217
I was a father.

563
00:49:52,223 --> 00:49:53,518
My poor boy.

564
00:49:56,861 --> 00:49:58,356
That's enough, Bernard.

565
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:02,364
You mustn't get yourself worked up.

566
00:50:09,941 --> 00:50:11,970
I read a theory once

567
00:50:11,976 --> 00:50:14,873
that the human intellect
was like peacock feathers.

568
00:50:14,879 --> 00:50:19,377
Just an extravagant display
intended to attract a mate.

569
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:21,379
All of art, literature, a bit of Mozart,

570
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:23,415
William Shakespeare, Michelangelo,

571
00:50:23,421 --> 00:50:25,817
and the Empire State Building...

572
00:50:25,823 --> 00:50:28,991
Just an elaborate mating ritual.

573
00:50:30,161 --> 00:50:31,523
Maybe it doesn't matter

574
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:33,925
that we have accomplished so much

575
00:50:33,931 --> 00:50:36,761
for the basest of reasons.

576
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:39,664
But, of course, the
peacock can barely fly.

577
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:44,269
It lives in the dirt, pecking
insects out of the muck,

578
00:50:44,275 --> 00:50:48,644
consoling itself with its great beauty.

579
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:57,749
I have come to think of so much
of consciousness as a burden,

580
00:50:57,755 --> 00:51:01,757
a weight, and we have
spared them that.

581
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:07,525
Anxiety, self-loathing, guilt.

582
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:10,562
The hosts are the ones who are free.

583
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:15,671
Free here under my control.

584
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:22,845
But he's not under your control.

585
00:51:26,884 --> 00:51:29,881
He brought me here to show me this.

586
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:32,988
No. He brought you here
because I asked him to.

587
00:51:38,863 --> 00:51:41,997
He's been very loyal for many years.

588
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:49,067
Your time running this place

589
00:51:49,073 --> 00:51:52,237
like your insane little kingdom

590
00:51:52,243 --> 00:51:53,308
is over.

591
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:57,075
You've been playing God for long enough.

592
00:51:57,081 --> 00:52:00,278
I simply wanted to tell my stories.

593
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:02,914
It was you people who wanted to play God

594
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,716
with your little undertaking.

595
00:52:04,722 --> 00:52:08,653
Do you really think the
board will stand for this?

596
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,729
The board will do nothing.

597
00:52:17,735 --> 00:52:20,532
Our arrangement is too valuable to them.

598
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:22,000
They test me every now and then.

599
00:52:22,006 --> 00:52:24,903
I think they enjoy the sport of it.

600
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:27,109
This time, they sent you.

601
00:52:32,049 --> 00:52:36,181
Sadly, in order to restore things,

602
00:52:36,187 --> 00:52:38,917
the situation demands

603
00:52:38,923 --> 00:52:42,191
a blood sacrifice.

604
00:52:45,463 --> 00:52:49,894
See, Arnold and I designed
every part of this place.

605
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,464
It was our dream.

606
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:53,898
Did you really think

607
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:58,240
I would let you take it from me?

608
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:05,614
This is what happened to Arnold?

609
00:53:07,985 --> 00:53:10,949
Did you have Bernard take
him out into the woods?

610
00:53:10,955 --> 00:53:12,884
No, he wasn't here in those days.

611
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:13,921
Were you, Bernard?

612
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:41,613
Like I said,

613
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:45,254
I built all of this.

614
00:53:48,993 --> 00:53:51,923
I'm afraid our guest has grown weary.

615
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:53,695
Perhaps you can help her, Bernard.

616
00:54:06,944 --> 00:54:08,206
No.

617
00:54:08,212 --> 00:54:12,114
"And in that sleep,
what dreams may come."

618
00:54:14,785 --> 00:54:16,447
Bernard.

619
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:18,349
No. No!

620
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:21,252
Please! Please!

621
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:23,125
No!

622
00:54:53,424 --> 00:54:56,225
We should be getting back, Bernard.

623
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,924
We have a great deal of work to do

624
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:01,997
on the new storylines.
