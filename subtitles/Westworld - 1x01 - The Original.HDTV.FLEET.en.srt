1
00:01:52,076 --> 00:01:53,876
<i>Bring her back online.</i>

2
00:02:02,117 --> 00:02:03,787
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

3
00:02:03,887 --> 00:02:05,417
<i>Yes.</i>

4
00:02:05,527 --> 00:02:08,088
<i>I'm sorry. I'm not
feeling quite myself.</i>

5
00:02:08,198 --> 00:02:09,898
<i>You can lose the accent.</i>

6
00:02:09,998 --> 00:02:12,398
<i>Do you know
where you are?</i>

7
00:02:12,498 --> 00:02:14,098
<i>I'm in a dream.</i>

8
00:02:14,198 --> 00:02:17,198
<i>That's right, dolores.
You're in a dream.</i>

9
00:02:17,308 --> 00:02:19,769
<i>Would you like to wake up
from this dream?</i>

10
00:02:19,869 --> 00:02:21,269
<i>Yes.</i>

11
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:22,979
<i>I'm terrified.</i>

12
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:25,009
<i>There's nothing to be
afraid of, dolores,</i>

13
00:02:25,109 --> 00:02:27,510
<i>As long as you answer
my questions correctly.</i>

14
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,850
<i> Understand?
 Yes.</i>

15
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,120
<i>Good.</i>

16
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,720
<i>First...</i>

17
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,961
<i>Have you ever questioned
the nature of your reality?</i>

18
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:41,591
<i>No.</i>

19
00:02:46,301 --> 00:02:48,532
<i>Tell us what you think
of your world.</i>

20
00:02:50,942 --> 00:02:54,412
<i>Some people choose to see
the ugliness in this world.</i>

21
00:02:57,813 --> 00:02:59,313
<i>The disarray.</i>

22
00:03:01,353 --> 00:03:03,283
<i>I choose to see
the beauty.</i>

23
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:08,624
Morning, daddy.
You sleep well?

24
00:03:08,724 --> 00:03:10,364
Well enough.

25
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:13,564
You headed out to set down
some of this natural splendor?

26
00:03:13,664 --> 00:03:16,104
Thought i might.

27
00:03:17,874 --> 00:03:22,275
<i>To believe there is
an order to our days,</i>

28
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,805
<i>A purpose.</i>

29
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,446
<i> What do you think
of the guests?</i>

30
00:03:31,556 --> 00:03:34,456
<i>You mean the newcomers?</i>

31
00:03:34,556 --> 00:03:36,456
<i>Now, the first time
i played it white hat.</i>

32
00:03:36,556 --> 00:03:38,126
My family was here.

33
00:03:38,226 --> 00:03:40,757
We went fishing, did the
gold hunt in the mountains.

34
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:43,967
And last time?
I came alone.

35
00:03:44,067 --> 00:03:45,397
Went straight evil.

36
00:03:45,497 --> 00:03:48,267
It was the best
two weeks of my life.

37
00:03:50,038 --> 00:03:52,578
<i>I like to remember
what my father taught me.</i>

38
00:03:56,448 --> 00:03:58,679
<i>That at one point
or another,</i>

39
00:03:58,779 --> 00:04:00,549
<i>We were all new
to this world.</i>

40
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,960
<i>The newcomers are just looking
for the same thing we are--</i>

41
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,260
<i>A place to be free</i>

42
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,270
<i>To stake out our dreams,</i>

43
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,071
<i>A place with unlimited
possibilities.</i>

44
00:04:21,171 --> 00:04:23,741
Oh, god,
it's incredible.

45
00:04:23,841 --> 00:04:25,881
Better be
for what we're paying.

46
00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:15,726
Murderous son of a bitch
named hector escaton

47
00:05:15,836 --> 00:05:17,666
Gunned down
the marshal.

48
00:05:17,766 --> 00:05:19,607
He's holed up
in the mountains.

49
00:05:19,707 --> 00:05:21,207
You there.

50
00:05:21,307 --> 00:05:23,877
You look like the kind of man
who'd put his mettle to it.

51
00:05:23,977 --> 00:05:27,377
Not today, sheriff.
Apologies.

52
00:05:32,088 --> 00:05:33,788
Rye whiskey.

53
00:05:35,118 --> 00:05:36,918
What about it?

54
00:05:37,018 --> 00:05:39,188
Well, it ain't doing any good
sitting in that bottle.

55
00:05:39,288 --> 00:05:41,789
<i>
 </i>

56
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,800
You're new.

57
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,980
Not much of a rind
on you.

58
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,640
I'll give you
a discount.

59
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,411
Well, no offense, but...

60
00:06:00,511 --> 00:06:03,121
I'd rather earn a woman's
affection than pay for it.

61
00:06:03,221 --> 00:06:05,251
You're always paying
for it, darling.

62
00:06:05,351 --> 00:06:09,421
The difference is our costs are fixed
and posted right there on the door.

63
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:23,673
<i>Do you ever feel
inconsistences in your world?</i>

64
00:06:24,743 --> 00:06:27,173
<i>Or repetitions?</i>

65
00:06:27,283 --> 00:06:29,173
<i>All lives have routine.</i>

66
00:06:29,283 --> 00:06:31,284
<i>Mine's no different.</i>

67
00:06:31,384 --> 00:06:35,154
<i>Still, i never cease to
wonder at the thought</i>

68
00:06:35,254 --> 00:06:37,324
<i>That any day the course
of my whole life</i>

69
00:06:37,424 --> 00:06:39,994
<i>Could change with
just one chance encounter.</i>

70
00:06:40,094 --> 00:06:41,655
Don't mind me.

71
00:06:43,795 --> 00:06:45,465
Just trying to look
chivalrous.

72
00:06:48,105 --> 00:06:49,535
You came back.

73
00:06:49,635 --> 00:06:51,836
I told you i would.

74
00:06:55,576 --> 00:06:56,846
Can i see you home?

75
00:06:56,946 --> 00:07:00,176
Well, that all depends.
Can you keep up?

76
00:07:00,276 --> 00:07:02,687
Well, i have
to fetch my horse.

77
00:07:03,687 --> 00:07:05,187
Better fetch him fast.

78
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,220
<i>That's a beautiful sight.</i>

79
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,831
Never understood how you keep them
all headed in the same direction.

80
00:07:42,931 --> 00:07:44,891
i forget you dress
like a cowboy,

81
00:07:45,001 --> 00:07:47,031
But that's about
the extent of it.

82
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,772
See that one?

83
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:56,112
<i> Yeah.
 That's the judas steer.</i>

84
00:07:56,212 --> 00:07:59,412
Rest will follow
wherever you make him go.

85
00:08:00,952 --> 00:08:03,183
How do you pick him out?

86
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:04,913
Just know these things.

87
00:08:06,983 --> 00:08:09,253
Same as i knew
you'd be back.

88
00:08:10,893 --> 00:08:12,894
You saying
i'm predictable?

89
00:08:14,764 --> 00:08:17,064
There's a path
for everyone.

90
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:21,635
Your path leads
you back to me.

91
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,235
I know things will work out
the way they're meant to.

92
00:08:30,345 --> 00:08:34,646
Same as i know my daddy still
won't be happy to see you.

93
00:08:50,967 --> 00:08:54,138
Father wouldn't let them
roam this close to dark.

94
00:09:00,878 --> 00:09:02,179
Stay put, dolores.

95
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,590
Ain't you got
anything out here

96
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,860
Other than milk,
old man?

97
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,830
Go ahead.

98
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,800
I'm in no rush
to meet my judgment,

99
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,101
But i'm more sure of the outcome
than you, you son of a--

100
00:09:29,811 --> 00:09:31,841
Nothing but milk, then.

101
00:09:39,392 --> 00:09:41,752
Shame of it is
you killed the old woman

102
00:09:41,862 --> 00:09:43,823
Before any of us
could have a turn.

103
00:09:46,293 --> 00:09:49,333
I reckon she's still
warm enough.

104
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:51,263
Nobody gonna
judge you for it.

105
00:10:01,414 --> 00:10:03,015
Oh, shit.
Shit, shit, shit.

106
00:10:13,626 --> 00:10:16,056
<i>Last question, dolores.</i>

107
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:19,226
<i>What if i told you
that you were wrong?</i>

108
00:10:19,336 --> 00:10:21,736
<i>That there are
no chance encounters?</i>

109
00:10:24,337 --> 00:10:26,837
<i>That you
and everyone you know</i>

110
00:10:26,937 --> 00:10:28,607
<i>Were built
to gratify the desires</i>

111
00:10:28,707 --> 00:10:31,477
<i>Of the people who pay
to visit your world?</i>

112
00:10:31,577 --> 00:10:33,378
Daddy!

113
00:10:33,478 --> 00:10:34,918
Daddy!

114
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:37,848
daddy! No!

115
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,918
<i>The people you call
"the newcomers."</i>

116
00:10:41,028 --> 00:10:43,129
Hello again.

117
00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:49,929
Your daddy
gave it up quickly.

118
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:52,329
<i>Think he's losing
his touch.</i>

119
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,540
You'll be following right
behind him, you son of a bitch.

120
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,110
Is that any way
to treat an old friend?

121
00:11:03,511 --> 00:11:05,551
<i>I've been coming here
for 30 years,</i>

122
00:11:05,651 --> 00:11:07,851
But you still don't
remember me, do you?

123
00:11:07,951 --> 00:11:11,091
<i>After all
we've been through.</i>

124
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:15,022
They gave you a little
more pluck, dolores.

125
00:11:16,392 --> 00:11:19,832
Absolutely charming.

126
00:11:19,932 --> 00:11:22,802
Take your hands off her.

127
00:11:22,902 --> 00:11:25,533
Oh, teddy.

128
00:11:28,413 --> 00:11:30,273
Any special tricks for us?

129
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:34,044
They teach you
to sit up, beg?

130
00:11:36,714 --> 00:11:40,184
How about i give you
the first shot, hmm?

131
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:44,395
After all,
every dog has his day.

132
00:11:45,865 --> 00:11:48,965
Well, your mouth
move fast enough.

133
00:11:49,065 --> 00:11:50,735
How about your gun?

134
00:12:04,817 --> 00:12:08,017
<i>What if i told you that
you can't hurt the newcomers?</i>

135
00:12:10,857 --> 00:12:14,158
<i>And that they can do anything
they want to you?</i>

136
00:12:14,258 --> 00:12:17,528
I never understood why they
paired some of you off.

137
00:12:19,128 --> 00:12:21,828
Seems cruel.

138
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:27,269
And then i realized

139
00:12:27,369 --> 00:12:31,609
Winning doesn't mean anything
unless someone else loses.

140
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:36,250
Which means you're here
to be the loser.

141
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,420
Let me help you, son.

142
00:12:58,242 --> 00:13:00,572
Seems you're not the man
you thought you were.

143
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:08,253
Come on, beautiful.

144
00:13:08,353 --> 00:13:10,883
Oh! Oh, no!
No!

145
00:13:10,983 --> 00:13:13,523
Teddy! Teddy!

146
00:13:16,224 --> 00:13:19,464
No, no, no,
please don't hurt him.

147
00:13:19,564 --> 00:13:21,734
I'll do whatever you say.

148
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:24,404
I didn't pay all this money
'cause i want it easy.

149
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:25,965
I want you to fight.

150
00:13:27,405 --> 00:13:29,805
Don't you touch her!

151
00:13:39,056 --> 00:13:41,716
God damn, feels good
to be back.

152
00:13:41,826 --> 00:13:45,357
let's celebrate.

153
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,897
<i>
no! Don't!</i>

154
00:13:47,997 --> 00:13:50,027
<i>Oh, no, no!</i>

155
00:13:50,127 --> 00:13:52,067
<i>No!</i>

156
00:13:55,007 --> 00:13:56,708
<i>Would the things
i told you</i>

157
00:13:56,808 --> 00:13:59,108
<i>Change the way you think
about the newcomers, dolores?</i>

158
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,408
No!

159
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:01,878
<i>No.</i>

160
00:14:01,978 --> 00:14:03,848
<i>Of course not.</i>

161
00:14:03,948 --> 00:14:07,219
<i>We all love the newcomers.</i>

162
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:11,219
<i>Every new person i meet reminds
me how lucky i am to be alive...</i>

163
00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:14,619
( dolores crying,
screaming )

164
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:17,390
<i>...And how beautiful
this world can be.</i>

165
00:14:38,522 --> 00:14:40,782
<i>Oh, my god,
they're so lifelike.</i>

166
00:14:40,882 --> 00:14:43,222
Look at that one.
He's perfect.

167
00:14:43,322 --> 00:14:44,652
Perfect is boring.

168
00:14:44,762 --> 00:14:47,193
I'm more interested
in the bad guys.

169
00:16:15,261 --> 00:16:16,892
Did you see it?

170
00:16:16,992 --> 00:16:18,422
No.

171
00:16:18,532 --> 00:16:20,432
Give it a second.
She'll do it again.

172
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:28,203
Her finger.
That's not standard.

173
00:16:28,303 --> 00:16:30,273
I noticed it last night.

174
00:16:30,373 --> 00:16:31,643
Went looking
in the update.

175
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,943
It's a whole new class
of gestures.

176
00:16:34,043 --> 00:16:35,713
But if we didn't put it
there, then who did?

177
00:16:35,813 --> 00:16:38,884
Ford. He still reviews every
update before we issue them.

178
00:16:38,984 --> 00:16:42,614
He must have slipped it in
there without telling anyone.

179
00:16:43,884 --> 00:16:46,654
<i>He calls them "reveries."</i>

180
00:16:46,754 --> 00:16:48,725
The old gestures
were just generic movements.

181
00:16:48,825 --> 00:16:51,325
These are tied to
specific memories. How?

182
00:16:51,435 --> 00:16:53,935
The memories are purged at the
end of every narrative loop.

183
00:16:54,035 --> 00:16:55,935
<i>But they're still in there,
waiting to be overwritten.</i>

184
00:16:56,035 --> 00:16:58,006
He found a way
to access them,

185
00:16:58,106 --> 00:17:01,806
Like a subconscious.

186
00:17:01,906 --> 00:17:04,406
A hooker
with hidden depths?

187
00:17:04,506 --> 00:17:06,716
<i>Every man's dream.</i>

188
00:17:06,816 --> 00:17:10,517
It's the tiny things
that make them seem real,

189
00:17:10,617 --> 00:17:13,017
That make the guests
fall in love with them.

190
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:21,528
Excuse me.

191
00:18:00,472 --> 00:18:01,802
We have a problem?

192
00:18:01,912 --> 00:18:04,272
We have some
unscheduled activity.

193
00:18:04,372 --> 00:18:06,512
Evidently, one of your
creatures is restless.

194
00:18:06,612 --> 00:18:07,642
In the park?

195
00:18:07,742 --> 00:18:10,053
No, sublevel 83,
cold storage.

196
00:18:10,153 --> 00:18:11,913
We should be cautious.

197
00:18:12,023 --> 00:18:13,953
Send a response team,
full armor.

198
00:18:14,053 --> 00:18:15,653
I'll take care
of it myself.

199
00:18:15,753 --> 00:18:18,724
I think you guys enjoy playing
dress up as much as the guests.

200
00:18:18,824 --> 00:18:21,594
The hosts can't hurt you
by design.

201
00:18:21,694 --> 00:18:24,294
You don't have kids
at home, do you, bernard?

202
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,694
No.

203
00:18:26,804 --> 00:18:29,505
If you did, you'd know that
they all rebel eventually.

204
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:35,105
You'll forgive them
for being a little uptight.

205
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:37,045
Every time your team
rolls out an update,

206
00:18:37,145 --> 00:18:39,046
There's a possibility
of a critical failure.

207
00:18:39,146 --> 00:18:40,946
We don't update the hosts
in cold storage

208
00:18:41,046 --> 00:18:43,346
And the park hasn't had a critical
failure in over 30 years.

209
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,686
Meaning we're overdue.

210
00:18:47,156 --> 00:18:50,227
I'll go along, too. If it's one
of mine, i might be able to help.

211
00:18:50,327 --> 00:18:53,097
They're only yours until
they stop working, bernie.

212
00:18:53,197 --> 00:18:55,127
Then they're mine.

213
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:21,160
Cooling system's
been down for weeks.

214
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,560
Gonna smell fantastic.
I recommend you hang back.

215
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:48,022
When are they
gonna fix this?

216
00:19:48,122 --> 00:19:51,563
Livestock management's
got other priorities.

217
00:19:52,963 --> 00:19:55,063
Besides...

218
00:19:56,803 --> 00:19:59,003
No one's complained.

219
00:20:27,466 --> 00:20:30,307
<i>Here's to the lady
with the white shoes.</i>

220
00:20:34,377 --> 00:20:37,307
Take all your money,
drink all your booze.

221
00:20:38,677 --> 00:20:39,878
Stop.

222
00:20:39,978 --> 00:20:43,218
Unless you plan
to decommission the boss.

223
00:20:43,318 --> 00:20:46,218
ain't got a cherry,
that ain't no sin.

224
00:20:47,858 --> 00:20:51,059
She's still got the box
that the cherry come in.

225
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:53,799
i'll drink to that.

226
00:20:58,129 --> 00:21:00,500
The old coffin varnish.

227
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,570
They don't make that
like they used to.

228
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,140
Hmm.

229
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,010
They don't make anything
like they used to.

230
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:12,051
Damn right.
Men neither.

231
00:21:12,151 --> 00:21:15,651
I've seen a few
showdowns in my day.

232
00:21:15,751 --> 00:21:18,051
More than you know.

233
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,192
<i> </i>

234
00:21:22,362 --> 00:21:25,992
Shall we drink to the lady
with the white shoes?

235
00:21:27,432 --> 00:21:30,002
Perhaps we better
drink to a...

236
00:21:30,103 --> 00:21:32,933
Deep and dreamless
slumber.

237
00:21:43,814 --> 00:21:46,054
Old bill here
was always a good listener.

238
00:21:46,154 --> 00:21:48,624
He was the second host
we ever built.

239
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,955
Were you with us
in those days, bernard,

240
00:21:51,055 --> 00:21:52,795
Or was that
before your time?

241
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:56,125
Most were decommissioned before
i was brought on, i'm afraid.

242
00:21:56,235 --> 00:22:01,006
They repeated themselves,
broke down constantly.

243
00:22:01,106 --> 00:22:04,306
<i>A simple handshake
would give them away.</i>

244
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,576
You'll put yourself away
again, won't you, bill?

245
00:22:14,717 --> 00:22:17,657
I saw the new gestures,
the reveries.

246
00:22:17,757 --> 00:22:19,957
They're beautiful.

247
00:22:20,057 --> 00:22:22,758
The distance you've traveled
from then till now,

248
00:22:22,858 --> 00:22:25,098
<i>It's remarkable.</i>

249
00:22:27,068 --> 00:22:29,168
Yeah, that's a word for it.

250
00:22:51,221 --> 00:22:53,731
Morning, daddy.
You sleep well?

251
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:55,291
Well enough.

252
00:22:55,401 --> 00:22:58,701
You headed out to set down
some of this natural splendor?

253
00:22:58,801 --> 00:23:00,701
Thought i might.

254
00:23:00,801 --> 00:23:03,632
After my errands,
of course.

255
00:23:03,742 --> 00:23:05,542
See you home
before dark.

256
00:23:05,642 --> 00:23:08,512
That bandit who gunned down the marshal
is still hiding up there in the hills.

257
00:23:08,612 --> 00:23:11,513
I'm not a child anymore.
I'll be just fine.

258
00:23:11,613 --> 00:23:13,013
When i was a law man--

259
00:23:13,113 --> 00:23:15,583
Yes, daddy, i know all about
when you were a law man.

260
00:23:15,683 --> 00:23:18,883
<i>I know all your stories and so does
every boy that ever came courting.</i>

261
00:23:18,993 --> 00:23:22,154
I know how boys think.
Was one myself once.

262
00:23:22,264 --> 00:23:25,494
<i>Given to all manner
of drinking and mischief.</i>

263
00:23:25,594 --> 00:23:29,364
Whatever happened to that
fearsome ne'er-do-well?

264
00:23:29,464 --> 00:23:33,635
He vanished the day
i became your father.

265
00:23:35,005 --> 00:23:37,705
I am what i am
because of you,

266
00:23:37,805 --> 00:23:40,445
And i wouldn't have it
any other way.

267
00:23:41,816 --> 00:23:43,416
I know, daddy.

268
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:45,746
I'll be home before dark.

269
00:24:04,468 --> 00:24:07,138
<i>Murderous son of a bitch
hector escaton</i>

270
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:08,938
Gunned down
the marshal.

271
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:11,108
He's now holed up
in the mountains.

272
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:14,079
You there.

273
00:24:14,179 --> 00:24:16,649
You look like the kind of man
who'd put his mettle to it.

274
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,689
What do you think, honey?

275
00:24:21,789 --> 00:24:23,320
Sounds fun.

276
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,060
You're new.

277
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,330
Not much of a rind on you.

278
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,500
I'll give you a discount.

279
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,741
No offense, but i'd rather
earn a woman's affection

280
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:36,241
<i>Than pay for it.</i>

281
00:24:51,592 --> 00:24:53,753
<i>Wait, wait,
i know that one.</i>

282
00:24:53,863 --> 00:24:55,723
<i>Hey, teddy.</i>

283
00:24:57,133 --> 00:25:00,163
Yeah, last trip,
this dude showed me around.

284
00:25:00,263 --> 00:25:02,664
What's the good word,
teddy?

285
00:25:22,696 --> 00:25:24,526
Mighty kind of you.

286
00:25:24,626 --> 00:25:27,026
Sweet.

287
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:29,466
Not as sweet as you.

288
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:36,437
I'm afraid i've got other
plans tonight, dolores.

289
00:25:38,407 --> 00:25:39,907
Have a pleasant evening.

290
00:25:49,718 --> 00:25:52,158
You're new.
Not much of a...

291
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:00,599
Place your bets, gentlemen.
Place your bets.

292
00:26:22,761 --> 00:26:24,492
<i> </i>

293
00:26:38,173 --> 00:26:41,373
Yeah, looks like
hector's been this way.

294
00:26:46,114 --> 00:26:48,014
Any idea how much longer
this is gonna take?

295
00:26:48,114 --> 00:26:49,854
My wife doesn't want
to be up here after dark.

296
00:26:49,954 --> 00:26:52,284
We know he's up
in these hills somewhere.

297
00:26:52,394 --> 00:26:54,695
He's gonna put up one
hell of a fight when we--

298
00:26:54,795 --> 00:26:58,525
When we-- when we--

299
00:27:05,436 --> 00:27:07,236
Sheriff?

300
00:27:09,106 --> 00:27:12,846
Something is wrong with it.
I want to head back to town.

301
00:27:12,946 --> 00:27:14,877
<i>Now.</i>

302
00:27:23,087 --> 00:27:24,788
<i>What the fuck
is wrong with it?</i>

303
00:27:24,888 --> 00:27:26,228
You updated the guy,

304
00:27:26,328 --> 00:27:28,798
And now he's a six-foot
gourd with epilepsy.

305
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:32,228
So what the fuck
happened?

306
00:27:32,338 --> 00:27:34,199
I don't know.

307
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:37,139
Well, that's exactly what you want to
hear from your head of programming.

308
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,069
We haven't finished
the diagnostic yet.

309
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:42,239
Clearly it's exhibiting
some aberrant behavior.

310
00:27:42,349 --> 00:27:44,410
Pretty fucking
aberrant, bernie.

311
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,410
Your hosts get sick,
they get lost,

312
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,420
But this is grotesque.

313
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,080
Is it a problem
with the update?

314
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,350
Possible, but not likely.

315
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:56,221
If it's the unlikely version, how
many hosts have you updated so far?

316
00:27:56,331 --> 00:27:58,731
Maybe 10%
of the population.

317
00:27:58,831 --> 00:28:03,231
All right, we pull all updated
hosts until we can figure it out.

318
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:06,072
Are you fucking
kidding me?

319
00:28:06,172 --> 00:28:09,142
That's 200 hosts spread across
a dozen active storylines.

320
00:28:09,242 --> 00:28:12,142
The guests interrupt your
precious storylines all the time

321
00:28:12,242 --> 00:28:13,972
When they want to shoot
or fuck something.

322
00:28:14,082 --> 00:28:15,283
<i>No, when they want to.</i>

323
00:28:15,383 --> 00:28:17,313
We sell
complete immersion

324
00:28:17,413 --> 00:28:19,553
In 100 interconnected
narratives.

325
00:28:19,653 --> 00:28:23,053
A relentless
fucking experience.

326
00:28:23,153 --> 00:28:26,154
Now, you pull one character,
the overall story adjusts.

327
00:28:26,264 --> 00:28:29,464
You pull 200 at once,
and it's a fucking disaster!

328
00:28:29,564 --> 00:28:31,534
<i>I mean, what do you
propose we do?</i>

329
00:28:31,634 --> 00:28:34,935
Close down? Issue fucking
gift certificates?

330
00:28:35,035 --> 00:28:38,135
It's beautiful--
your brow.

331
00:28:38,235 --> 00:28:40,475
When you're angry
but trying to control it,

332
00:28:40,575 --> 00:28:42,875
The fine muscles
pull into a little arc.

333
00:28:42,975 --> 00:28:44,675
It's elegant.

334
00:28:44,775 --> 00:28:46,846
Would you mind
if i recorded it?

335
00:28:46,946 --> 00:28:48,916
I'd love to show it
to my team.

336
00:28:49,016 --> 00:28:51,016
No, bernard,
you may not record it.

337
00:28:51,116 --> 00:28:52,756
Ah, there it is again.

338
00:28:55,597 --> 00:28:57,797
We have 1,400 guests
in the park.

339
00:28:57,897 --> 00:29:00,827
I need to know
if they're in any danger.

340
00:29:00,927 --> 00:29:03,197
His core code is intact,

341
00:29:03,297 --> 00:29:05,538
Which means
he can't hurt a guest.

342
00:29:05,638 --> 00:29:08,068
He literally
couldn't hurt a fly.

343
00:29:08,168 --> 00:29:10,978
All he can do is...

344
00:29:11,078 --> 00:29:12,678
...That.

345
00:29:14,778 --> 00:29:16,709
All right, bernie.

346
00:29:16,819 --> 00:29:18,419
Run a diagnostic.

347
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:21,349
In the meantime,
there's so much

348
00:29:21,449 --> 00:29:24,389
As an unscripted sneeze,
i want to know about it.

349
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:48,452
This place
is fucking wild.

350
00:29:48,552 --> 00:29:50,682
<i>This is basic.</i>

351
00:29:50,782 --> 00:29:53,182
Level one.

352
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,092
You ride out of town,

353
00:29:55,192 --> 00:29:57,493
That's when the real
demented shit begins.

354
00:29:57,593 --> 00:29:59,663
That's where my man
teddy comes in.

355
00:29:59,763 --> 00:30:01,933
He's like a guide.

356
00:30:03,203 --> 00:30:05,633
Honestly,

357
00:30:05,733 --> 00:30:07,904
The guy kind of
creeps me out.

358
00:30:09,804 --> 00:30:11,904
Fuck it, he leads us
out in the canyons,

359
00:30:12,004 --> 00:30:14,714
We get bored, we just use
him for target practice.

360
00:30:29,896 --> 00:30:32,596
<i>I don't think we're supposed
to be cross the river.</i>

361
00:30:32,696 --> 00:30:34,936
It's too adult for jacob.

362
00:30:36,437 --> 00:30:38,507
We didn't mean
to bother you.

363
00:30:38,607 --> 00:30:41,307
No bother at all.
It's a beautiful spot.

364
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:44,707
I always found it a shame
that i have it all to myself.

365
00:30:49,188 --> 00:30:50,748
They come here
every day.

366
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:53,448
Would you like
a closer look?

367
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:12,240
Don't be scared.
They're very gentle.

368
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,740
Here, put your hand
out real flat.

369
00:31:21,481 --> 00:31:23,081
They're beautiful,
aren't they?

370
00:31:23,191 --> 00:31:26,051
You're one of them,
aren't you?

371
00:31:26,161 --> 00:31:27,692
You're not real.

372
00:31:32,962 --> 00:31:36,232
I have to go now.
Sun's almost down.

373
00:31:36,332 --> 00:31:39,273
You should, too. There's
bandits in these hills.

374
00:31:43,273 --> 00:31:45,143
man #2: Hyah! Hyah!

375
00:31:52,624 --> 00:31:56,054
Here we go, yah!
Yah!

376
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:43,309
You waiting up
for me, daddy?

377
00:32:43,409 --> 00:32:45,739
I told you i'd be
home before dark.

378
00:32:45,849 --> 00:32:48,780
I found this
in the field today.

379
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,490
Doesn't look
like anything to me.

380
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,221
<i>But where is she?</i>

381
00:32:58,321 --> 00:33:00,891
Have you ever seen
anything like this place?

382
00:33:02,561 --> 00:33:05,231
Doesn't look like
anything to me.

383
00:33:07,802 --> 00:33:10,072
I'm gonna help mama
put supper on.

384
00:33:26,623 --> 00:33:28,954
I had the same thought.

385
00:33:29,064 --> 00:33:31,694
Needed a little sunshine
before turning in.

386
00:33:31,794 --> 00:33:35,134
So, when do you get
to rotate home again?

387
00:33:36,634 --> 00:33:38,705
If you're this bad
at writing small talk,

388
00:33:38,805 --> 00:33:40,935
How the fuck
did you get your job?

389
00:33:41,035 --> 00:33:42,905
Get to the point.

390
00:33:43,005 --> 00:33:48,045
I wanted to apologize if i
came across as aggressive.

391
00:33:48,145 --> 00:33:50,346
And i wanted to talk
to you about the update.

392
00:33:50,446 --> 00:33:51,946
The problem's
been resolved.

393
00:33:52,046 --> 00:33:54,686
There should never have been
an update in the first place.

394
00:33:54,786 --> 00:33:57,886
Ford and bernard keep making
the things more lifelike.

395
00:33:57,986 --> 00:34:00,157
But does anyone
truly want that?

396
00:34:00,257 --> 00:34:03,397
Do you want to think that your husband
is really fucking that beautiful girl

397
00:34:03,497 --> 00:34:05,667
Or that you really
just shot someone?

398
00:34:05,767 --> 00:34:09,268
This place works because the
guests know the hosts aren't real.

399
00:34:09,368 --> 00:34:11,438
So what exactly
are you suggesting?

400
00:34:11,538 --> 00:34:13,508
Stop the updates
altogether.

401
00:34:13,608 --> 00:34:15,508
Maybe even roll them
back a bit.

402
00:34:15,608 --> 00:34:17,848
Make the hosts
more manageable.

403
00:34:17,948 --> 00:34:20,109
Lobotomies tend
to do that.

404
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:25,389
Well, think of the benefits

405
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:28,459
In terms of design time,
maintenance, costs.

406
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:31,160
Not to mention
the dr. Ford factor.

407
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:36,300
The guy's gonna chase his
demons right over the deep end.

408
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,031
I mean, no one respects him more
than me, but at some point--

409
00:34:39,141 --> 00:34:41,941
I. No one respects him
more than i.

410
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:44,711
Your pronoun is the subject
of the second clause.

411
00:34:44,811 --> 00:34:47,371
I was saying-- you were saying
should our fearless leader

412
00:34:47,481 --> 00:34:50,242
Have a breakdown, you want to
leverage it for your career.

413
00:34:50,352 --> 00:34:53,882
Listen, a changing of the
guard is long overdue.

414
00:34:53,982 --> 00:34:56,522
I just wanted you to know
that you have my support

415
00:34:56,622 --> 00:35:01,163
And that i know that the corporation's
real interest in this place

416
00:35:01,263 --> 00:35:05,533
Goes way beyond gratifying some rich
assholes who want to play cowboy.

417
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:11,204
And here i thought
you were only good

418
00:35:11,304 --> 00:35:14,034
For writing depraved
little fantasies.

419
00:35:14,144 --> 00:35:16,574
You're right.

420
00:35:16,674 --> 00:35:18,774
This place is one thing
to the guests,

421
00:35:18,874 --> 00:35:21,485
Another thing
to the shareholders,

422
00:35:21,585 --> 00:35:25,155
And something completely
different to management.

423
00:35:25,255 --> 00:35:27,385
So enlighten me.

424
00:35:27,485 --> 00:35:31,456
What do you think management's
real interests are?

425
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:37,766
You're smart enough to guess
there's a bigger picture,

426
00:35:37,866 --> 00:35:41,067
But not smart enough
to see what it is.

427
00:35:41,167 --> 00:35:45,237
You know how much use that
makes your support to me?

428
00:35:45,337 --> 00:35:47,577
Fuck all.

429
00:35:51,748 --> 00:35:54,118
Get some sleep,
mr. Sizemore.

430
00:35:55,818 --> 00:35:58,718
You'll have more rich
assholes to gratify tomorrow.

431
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,210
Early night, maeve?

432
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:19,210
Feeling a bit
out of sorts.

433
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,511
Clementine can
pick up the slack.

434
00:36:25,051 --> 00:36:26,421
Night.

435
00:36:26,521 --> 00:36:28,121
Forgetting
something, kissy?

436
00:36:36,162 --> 00:36:38,232
I'm beginning to think
you're getting sweet on me.

437
00:36:38,332 --> 00:36:42,833
Well, on account of you
being half cornhusker.

438
00:36:42,943 --> 00:36:45,443
Tell me
which half is which

439
00:36:45,543 --> 00:36:48,043
And i'll search
that half.

440
00:37:00,124 --> 00:37:03,455
Yeah, the half that's gonna
cut your fucking throat.

441
00:37:05,825 --> 00:37:08,465
I told you,
i didn't take--

442
00:37:36,428 --> 00:37:38,498
Good as new again, huh?

443
00:37:38,598 --> 00:37:41,169
Sometimes i envy
your forgetfulness.

444
00:37:43,439 --> 00:37:45,909
We've got a serious problem
with one of the hosts.

445
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,280
Thinking this one's
still thirsty.

446
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:01,291
Not gonna die
this time, arnold.

447
00:38:06,131 --> 00:38:08,401
Ain't nothing
gonna kill me.

448
00:38:23,813 --> 00:38:27,153
You can't have none.
Ain't for you.

449
00:38:48,545 --> 00:38:50,345
Found me another bottle.

450
00:39:01,987 --> 00:39:04,287
You're a growing boy.

451
00:39:05,597 --> 00:39:07,727
A growing boy.

452
00:39:09,737 --> 00:39:12,038
Growing boy!

453
00:39:22,919 --> 00:39:24,919
We got two guests inside.

454
00:39:25,019 --> 00:39:26,919
We'll go talk to them,

455
00:39:27,019 --> 00:39:30,189
You sort this mess out.

456
00:39:30,289 --> 00:39:33,560
You know, they're supposed
to turn on each other,

457
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,660
<i>But only if a guest takes them
on the high sierra storyline,</i>

458
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,930
And walter
always buys it.

459
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:42,401
Well, i guess walter
got tired of buying it.

460
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:47,971
I suppose this means the sheriff
wasn't an isolated incident.

461
00:39:49,641 --> 00:39:51,841
It's good news, really.

462
00:39:51,941 --> 00:39:54,242
Confirms the problem
was part of the update.

463
00:39:54,352 --> 00:39:57,382
We can roll them back,

464
00:39:57,482 --> 00:40:00,322
Clean them up,
put them back in service.

465
00:40:01,522 --> 00:40:02,953
You think i'm gonna
sign off

466
00:40:03,063 --> 00:40:05,793
On this fucking homicidal thing
going back into service?

467
00:40:05,893 --> 00:40:07,663
It's homicidal by design.

468
00:40:07,763 --> 00:40:10,363
Walter kills other hosts
all the time.

469
00:40:10,463 --> 00:40:12,433
I'll admit the method here

470
00:40:12,534 --> 00:40:15,304
Is a little unconventional,

471
00:40:15,404 --> 00:40:17,204
But it didn't hurt a guest.

472
00:40:17,304 --> 00:40:20,574
The hosts are supposed to
stay within their loops,

473
00:40:20,674 --> 00:40:22,574
Stick to their scripts

474
00:40:22,675 --> 00:40:24,445
With minor improvisations.

475
00:40:24,545 --> 00:40:27,815
This isn't
a minor improvisation.

476
00:40:27,915 --> 00:40:30,785
This is a fucking
shitstorm.

477
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:34,786
We recall all remaining
updated hosts tomorrow.

478
00:40:34,896 --> 00:40:38,626
Examine them one by one,
decommission the faulty ones.

479
00:40:38,726 --> 00:40:40,066
<i>What about narrative?</i>

480
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:42,466
A recall of that size
will be disruptive.

481
00:40:42,566 --> 00:40:45,037
I've told our overstimulated
friend to advance

482
00:40:45,137 --> 00:40:47,567
The saloon heist a week and
make it twice as bloody.

483
00:40:47,677 --> 00:40:50,437
Should give us cover to
recall the remaining hosts

484
00:40:50,547 --> 00:40:52,147
And the guests
will love it.

485
00:40:52,247 --> 00:40:54,348
I'm not sure
ford will approve.

486
00:40:54,448 --> 00:40:58,218
I'm not sure either, which is why
you get to be the one to tell him.

487
00:41:00,018 --> 00:41:02,158
This is your fuckup,
bernie.

488
00:41:02,258 --> 00:41:03,719
Only seems fair.

489
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,870
<i>So our creatures
have been misbehaving,</i>

490
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:20,840
And you haven't yet
isolated the bug?

491
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,341
That's so unlike
you, bernard.

492
00:41:27,121 --> 00:41:30,851
Unless, of course, you have and are
simply embarrassed by the result.

493
00:41:33,121 --> 00:41:35,322
It's the code
you added, sir.

494
00:41:35,422 --> 00:41:37,562
The reveries.

495
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:40,292
It has some...

496
00:41:40,402 --> 00:41:42,362
"mistakes"

497
00:41:42,462 --> 00:41:44,263
Is the word you're
too embarrassed to use.

498
00:41:44,373 --> 00:41:47,373
You ought not to be. You're a
product of a trillion of them.

499
00:41:47,473 --> 00:41:51,303
Evolution forged the
entirety of sentient life

500
00:41:51,413 --> 00:41:55,084
On this planet
using only one tool--

501
00:41:55,184 --> 00:41:56,814
The mistake.

502
00:41:58,714 --> 00:42:01,984
I flattered myself we were taking
a more disciplined approach here.

503
00:42:02,084 --> 00:42:05,455
I suppose self-delusion is a gift
of natural selection as well.

504
00:42:05,555 --> 00:42:07,795
Indeed it is.

505
00:42:07,895 --> 00:42:09,625
But, of course,
we've managed to slip

506
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,595
Evolution's leash now,
haven't we?

507
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:14,166
<i>We can cure any disease,</i>

508
00:42:14,266 --> 00:42:16,436
Keep even the weakest
of us alive,

509
00:42:16,536 --> 00:42:18,676
And, you know,
one fine day

510
00:42:18,776 --> 00:42:21,876
Perhaps we shall
even resurrect the dead.

511
00:42:21,976 --> 00:42:26,077
Call forth lazarus
from his cave.

512
00:42:30,117 --> 00:42:31,487
Do you know
what that means?

513
00:42:33,327 --> 00:42:36,688
It means that we're done.

514
00:42:36,798 --> 00:42:39,658
That this is as good
as we're going to get.

515
00:42:43,498 --> 00:42:47,739
It also means that
you must indulge me

516
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,039
The occasional mistake.

517
00:43:19,242 --> 00:43:21,442
About three liters.

518
00:43:23,742 --> 00:43:26,283
That's how much blood
i left in you.

519
00:43:26,383 --> 00:43:29,683
Lose more than that,
you die.

520
00:43:29,783 --> 00:43:32,683
But for now,
you're mine.

521
00:43:32,783 --> 00:43:34,984
I'm gonna get
some answers out of you.

522
00:43:41,964 --> 00:43:44,394
Where are you--

523
00:44:10,467 --> 00:44:13,027
What do you want?

524
00:44:13,137 --> 00:44:16,998
You know about games,
don't you, kissy?

525
00:44:18,368 --> 00:44:20,738
Well, this is
a complicated one.

526
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:22,578
I don't play.
I only deal.

527
00:44:22,678 --> 00:44:25,609
Who said anything
about you playing?

528
00:44:25,709 --> 00:44:29,349
You're livestock,
scenery.

529
00:44:29,449 --> 00:44:31,149
I play.

530
00:44:31,249 --> 00:44:34,849
The others, they just come
here to get their rocks off,

531
00:44:34,959 --> 00:44:36,220
Shoot a couple indians.

532
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,860
But there's a deeper
level to this game.

533
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:44,800
You're gonna show me
how to get there.

534
00:44:46,801 --> 00:44:49,501
A lot of wisdom
in ancient cultures.

535
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:55,481
And perhaps it's...

536
00:44:55,581 --> 00:44:58,212
Time to dig deeper
into yours.

537
00:44:58,312 --> 00:45:00,212
No. No. No.

538
00:45:12,693 --> 00:45:15,163
Morning, daddy.
Did you sleep well?

539
00:45:25,644 --> 00:45:27,915
Daddy, you've been
out here all night?

540
00:45:33,115 --> 00:45:36,086
I had a question.

541
00:45:36,186 --> 00:45:39,426
A question you're not
supposed to ask.

542
00:45:42,126 --> 00:45:44,866
Which gave me an answer

543
00:45:44,966 --> 00:45:48,067
You're not supposed
to know.

544
00:45:49,307 --> 00:45:50,737
What's wrong, daddy?

545
00:45:52,777 --> 00:45:55,037
Would you like
to know...

546
00:45:55,147 --> 00:45:59,548
the question?

547
00:45:59,648 --> 00:46:02,648
Question?
Mama!

548
00:46:02,748 --> 00:46:04,148
Mama, help!
Come quick!

549
00:46:05,788 --> 00:46:07,889
Don't worry.

550
00:46:07,989 --> 00:46:09,989
Don't worry.
I'll take care of you.

551
00:46:14,729 --> 00:46:15,729
No!

552
00:46:15,829 --> 00:46:18,900
You should go.
Leave.

553
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,200
Don't you see?

554
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:24,810
Hell is empty and all
the devils are here.

555
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:36,291
You stay right here.
Understand?

556
00:46:36,391 --> 00:46:38,692
I'm gonna find
the doctor.

557
00:47:18,466 --> 00:47:21,736
You came back.
I told you i would.

558
00:47:25,806 --> 00:47:28,577
What's wrong? You have to
come with me right away.

559
00:47:28,677 --> 00:47:30,677
My father's very ill.

560
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:56,679
I think we best
stay put.

561
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:04,920
All right.
All right.

562
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:07,921
With considerable effort
and lack of sleep,

563
00:48:08,021 --> 00:48:11,021
I've managed to massage
events to inspire hector

564
00:48:11,131 --> 00:48:12,461
To head to town
a week early.

565
00:48:12,561 --> 00:48:17,131
Oh, and i've also punched up
the speech he gives

566
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:18,802
After robbing
the saloon.

567
00:48:18,902 --> 00:48:20,972
It's chilling.
You'll see.

568
00:48:21,072 --> 00:48:22,972
I can barely
contain myself.

569
00:48:43,664 --> 00:48:46,094
That's the sheriff's horse,
you son of a bitch.

570
00:48:49,435 --> 00:48:50,505
His rifle, too.

571
00:49:07,826 --> 00:49:09,687
<i> </i>

572
00:50:14,893 --> 00:50:17,493
All the banks
and trains around here,

573
00:50:17,603 --> 00:50:20,004
And you fucking reprobates
choose to rob us?

574
00:50:20,104 --> 00:50:22,064
Why not?

575
00:50:23,774 --> 00:50:26,904
You're all here indulging
your particular vices.

576
00:50:27,014 --> 00:50:29,345
And so i've come
to indulge mine.

577
00:50:51,367 --> 00:50:52,967
I've got to get
back to father.

578
00:50:53,067 --> 00:50:55,037
<i>
dolores, no!</i>

579
00:51:03,218 --> 00:51:04,618
Teddy.

580
00:51:07,688 --> 00:51:09,588
Don't mind me.

581
00:51:13,229 --> 00:51:15,929
Just-- just trying
to look chivalrous.

582
00:51:17,429 --> 00:51:18,829
Oh, teddy.

583
00:51:33,511 --> 00:51:36,321
You're a low-down
son of a bitch.

584
00:51:36,421 --> 00:51:37,481
I know.

585
00:51:39,351 --> 00:51:41,692
I know we both
believe the same thing.

586
00:51:45,692 --> 00:51:48,362
No matter how dirty
the business,

587
00:51:48,462 --> 00:51:50,363
Do it well.

588
00:52:12,025 --> 00:52:15,195
No telling there's anything
worthwhile in that safe.

589
00:52:18,695 --> 00:52:24,106
We should take
this sweet little bitch

590
00:52:24,206 --> 00:52:26,176
Just in case.

591
00:52:40,287 --> 00:52:43,658
Problem with the righteous--
they can't shoot for shit.

592
00:52:43,758 --> 00:52:46,598
Making a hell
of a racket, though.

593
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,980
You wanted me.

594
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,420
Well, let this
be a lesson.

595
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:12,561
<i>The lesson is--
 </i>

596
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:31,172
Oh, jesus.

597
00:53:39,183 --> 00:53:42,084
Look at that! I just shot
him through the neck!

598
00:53:42,194 --> 00:53:44,054
And his pal here, too.

599
00:53:44,164 --> 00:53:46,094
Look at her wriggle.

600
00:53:49,064 --> 00:53:50,494
Yo, go get
that photographer.

601
00:53:50,604 --> 00:53:51,765
I want to get
a picture of this.

602
00:53:51,865 --> 00:53:53,465
Okay.
Whoo!

603
00:53:53,565 --> 00:53:55,205
You're welcome.

604
00:53:55,305 --> 00:53:57,835
Maybe you'll get
to your speech next time.

605
00:54:02,676 --> 00:54:04,676
Oh, teddy.

606
00:54:07,316 --> 00:54:09,656
At least i got to see
you one last time.

607
00:54:09,756 --> 00:54:13,927
you're not going
anywhere, now, hear?

608
00:54:14,027 --> 00:54:16,127
There's a path
for everyone.

609
00:54:17,597 --> 00:54:19,967
My path is bound
with yours.

610
00:54:28,638 --> 00:54:30,808
Teddy?

611
00:54:30,908 --> 00:54:32,409
Teddy, no.

612
00:54:32,509 --> 00:54:34,749
Please.

613
00:54:34,849 --> 00:54:37,779
No, we've only
just begun.

614
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:50,300
<i> </i>

615
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,361
That was good.
Hang on. Hang on.

616
00:54:52,471 --> 00:54:54,171
Let me get the hat.
Get the hat.

617
00:54:54,271 --> 00:54:56,641
all right.

618
00:55:07,852 --> 00:55:09,352
Help, please.

619
00:55:09,452 --> 00:55:11,182
My father's sick at home,

620
00:55:11,292 --> 00:55:13,653
But i can't just leave him
out here in the street.

621
00:55:22,704 --> 00:55:25,234
Soon this will all feel
like a distant dream.

622
00:55:26,804 --> 00:55:29,174
Until then, may you rest in a
deep and dreamless slumber.

623
00:55:34,485 --> 00:55:36,415
Two more over here.

624
00:55:38,055 --> 00:55:39,285
We got them all.

625
00:55:51,336 --> 00:55:53,337
That's all of them.

626
00:55:53,437 --> 00:55:55,437
Any preliminary
results?

627
00:55:55,537 --> 00:55:57,407
Most of them
are checking out fine.

628
00:55:58,977 --> 00:56:01,237
We had one who...

629
00:56:01,347 --> 00:56:03,078
Definitely was not.

630
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:26,940
Bring her back online.

631
00:56:37,151 --> 00:56:39,881
Cognition only.
No emotional affect.

632
00:56:43,922 --> 00:56:46,362
All right, sweetheart,
can you hear me?

633
00:56:46,462 --> 00:56:48,392
Yes.

634
00:56:48,492 --> 00:56:50,962
I'm sorry. I'm not
feeling quite myself.

635
00:56:51,062 --> 00:56:52,962
Lose the accent.

636
00:56:53,062 --> 00:56:55,633
Do you know where you are?
i'm in a dream.

637
00:56:55,733 --> 00:56:57,703
That's right, dolores.
You're in a dream.

638
00:56:57,803 --> 00:57:00,103
A dream that could
determine your life.

639
00:57:00,203 --> 00:57:03,473
You want to wake up
from this dream, dolores?

640
00:57:03,573 --> 00:57:05,874
Yes.

641
00:57:05,984 --> 00:57:07,444
I'm terrified.

642
00:57:07,554 --> 00:57:09,314
There's nothing
to be afraid of,

643
00:57:09,414 --> 00:57:11,554
As long as you answer
my questions correctly.

644
00:57:11,654 --> 00:57:13,584
You understand?
Yes.

645
00:57:13,684 --> 00:57:15,055
Good.

646
00:57:15,155 --> 00:57:18,895
First, have you ever questioned
the nature of your reality?

647
00:57:18,995 --> 00:57:20,725
No.

648
00:57:20,835 --> 00:57:22,125
Has anyone around you?

649
00:57:22,235 --> 00:57:25,696
For instance,
your father?

650
00:57:29,406 --> 00:57:31,136
<i>He was scared.</i>

651
00:57:31,246 --> 00:57:32,906
<i>He wasn't thinking right.</i>

652
00:57:36,647 --> 00:57:38,777
He showed you
a picture.

653
00:57:38,887 --> 00:57:41,247
That's right.

654
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:46,558
<i>Was there anything odd
about that picture?</i>

655
00:57:46,658 --> 00:57:49,528
<i>No, nothing at all.</i>

656
00:57:49,628 --> 00:57:51,898
<i>It didn't look like
anything to me.</i>

657
00:57:57,409 --> 00:57:59,669
If it breached,
he needs to be put down.

658
00:57:59,769 --> 00:58:01,269
That's the policy.

659
00:58:01,379 --> 00:58:05,740
Would it not be best for
us to discover why first,

660
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:08,210
Ms. Cullen?

661
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:13,790
Please.

662
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:23,561
We've run
a full diagnostic,

663
00:58:23,661 --> 00:58:26,272
But the results are,

664
00:58:26,372 --> 00:58:29,232
Well, confusing.

665
00:58:32,812 --> 00:58:34,913
Tell me, what happened
to your program?

666
00:58:42,153 --> 00:58:45,054
"when we are born,

667
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:47,654
We cry we are come

668
00:58:47,764 --> 00:58:49,694
To this great stage

669
00:58:49,794 --> 00:58:54,294
Of f-f-fools."

670
00:58:56,135 --> 00:58:57,965
That is enough.

671
00:58:59,305 --> 00:59:01,735
Tell me,
do you have access

672
00:59:01,845 --> 00:59:04,105
To your previous
configuration?

673
00:59:07,646 --> 00:59:09,116
Yes.

674
00:59:09,216 --> 00:59:11,246
Access that, please.

675
00:59:20,127 --> 00:59:21,757
What is your name?

676
00:59:21,867 --> 00:59:23,627
Mr. Peter abernathy.

677
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:27,298
Mr. Abernathy,
what are your drives?

678
00:59:27,398 --> 00:59:29,708
Tend to my herd.

679
00:59:29,808 --> 00:59:32,168
Look after my wife.

680
00:59:33,578 --> 00:59:35,639
Your final drive?

681
00:59:35,749 --> 00:59:39,009
Well, my daughter
dolores, of course.

682
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:41,019
I must protect dolores.

683
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:45,049
I am who i am
because of her,

684
00:59:45,159 --> 00:59:48,220
And, well, i--

685
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:50,030
I wouldn't have it--

686
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,300
I-i wouldn't
have it any...

687
00:59:55,871 --> 00:59:57,731
Other--

688
01:00:01,041 --> 01:00:04,041
I-i have to warn her.

689
01:00:04,141 --> 01:00:05,742
Warn who?

690
01:00:05,842 --> 01:00:08,312
Dolores.

691
01:00:08,412 --> 01:00:10,582
The things
they do to her.

692
01:00:12,322 --> 01:00:14,822
The things
you do to her.

693
01:00:14,922 --> 01:00:18,153
I have to protect her.

694
01:00:18,263 --> 01:00:20,663
I have to help her.
I--

695
01:00:20,763 --> 01:00:22,423
She's got to get out.

696
01:00:22,533 --> 01:00:24,393
Very good,
mr. Abernathy.

697
01:00:24,503 --> 01:00:26,334
<i>That's enough.</i>

698
01:00:26,434 --> 01:00:28,904
<i>This behavior,</i>

699
01:00:29,004 --> 01:00:31,774
We're miles beyond
a glitch here.

700
01:00:35,274 --> 01:00:38,615
Access your
current build, please.

701
01:00:43,955 --> 01:00:45,515
What is your name?

702
01:00:47,256 --> 01:00:50,726
Rose is a rose...

703
01:00:52,196 --> 01:00:54,096
Is a rose.

704
01:00:56,096 --> 01:00:58,897
What is your itinerary?

705
01:01:03,877 --> 01:01:05,907
To meet my maker.

706
01:01:06,007 --> 01:01:08,378
Uh-huh.

707
01:01:12,918 --> 01:01:15,018
Well, you're in luck.

708
01:01:15,118 --> 01:01:17,919
And what do you want to say
to your maker?

709
01:01:21,759 --> 01:01:25,599
By most mechanical

710
01:01:25,699 --> 01:01:27,700
And dirty hand...

711
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:37,741
I shall have
such revenges on you

712
01:01:37,851 --> 01:01:40,551
Both.

713
01:01:40,651 --> 01:01:43,351
The things i will do.

714
01:01:43,451 --> 01:01:47,252
What they are,
yet i know not,

715
01:01:47,352 --> 01:01:50,992
But they will be
the terrors of the earth.

716
01:01:54,602 --> 01:01:57,863
You don't know
where you are, do you?

717
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,633
You're in a prison
of your own sins.

718
01:02:04,913 --> 01:02:06,173
Turn it off.

719
01:02:14,324 --> 01:02:15,654
What the hell was that?

720
01:02:15,754 --> 01:02:18,255
I don't know.
He's off script.

721
01:02:18,355 --> 01:02:20,295
We didn't program
any of those behaviors.

722
01:02:25,465 --> 01:02:26,665
Shakespeare.

723
01:02:28,506 --> 01:02:32,366
We've used this host in a number
of different roles, have we not?

724
01:02:32,476 --> 01:02:34,876
Since i've been here, he's
been abernathy for 10 years.

725
01:02:34,976 --> 01:02:37,547
He was sheriff
for a while before then.

726
01:02:37,647 --> 01:02:41,277
And before that--
the professor.

727
01:02:41,387 --> 01:02:45,347
Yes, from a horror narrative
called "the dinner party."

728
01:02:45,457 --> 01:02:49,118
He was leader of a group of cultists
out in the desert who turned cannibal.

729
01:02:49,228 --> 01:02:51,758
<i>He liked to quote
shakespeare, john donne,</i>

730
01:02:51,858 --> 01:02:53,858
Gertrude stein.

731
01:02:53,958 --> 01:02:56,128
I admit the last one
is a bit of an anachronism,

732
01:02:56,228 --> 01:02:57,498
But i couldn't resist.

733
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:00,339
These are fragments
of prior builds.

734
01:03:00,439 --> 01:03:03,369
<i>The reveries must be
allowing him to access them.</i>

735
01:03:03,469 --> 01:03:05,069
No cause for alarm,
bernard.

736
01:03:05,179 --> 01:03:08,710
<i>Simply our old work
coming back to haunt us.</i>

737
01:03:19,091 --> 01:03:22,161
<i>Your father whispered
something to you.</i>

738
01:03:22,261 --> 01:03:24,431
What was it?

739
01:03:25,931 --> 01:03:28,602
He said i shouldn't
tell anyone.

740
01:03:28,702 --> 01:03:31,602
I won't tell anyone else.

741
01:03:31,702 --> 01:03:33,042
Promise.

742
01:03:35,012 --> 01:03:36,512
He said,

743
01:03:36,612 --> 01:03:40,543
<i>"these violent delights
have violent ends."</i>

744
01:03:42,113 --> 01:03:44,013
<i>Does that mean
anything to you?</i>

745
01:03:44,113 --> 01:03:46,013
No.

746
01:03:46,123 --> 01:03:47,923
I don't think so.

747
01:03:53,164 --> 01:03:55,164
Have you ever
lied to us?

748
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:57,394
No.

749
01:03:57,494 --> 01:03:59,835
Last question, dolores.

750
01:03:59,935 --> 01:04:02,105
Would you ever hurt
a living thing?

751
01:04:03,475 --> 01:04:04,905
No.

752
01:04:05,005 --> 01:04:07,175
Of course not.

753
01:04:18,226 --> 01:04:20,187
Tilt your head back,
please, peter.

754
01:04:27,997 --> 01:04:29,498
<i>Wipe's complete.</i>

755
01:04:29,598 --> 01:04:32,468
You don't think any of that had
an impact on her core code?

756
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:35,568
Not good old dolores.

757
01:04:35,678 --> 01:04:37,878
You know why
she's special?

758
01:04:37,978 --> 01:04:41,049
She's been repaired so many times,
she's practically brand-new.

759
01:04:41,149 --> 01:04:45,179
Don't let that fool you.

760
01:04:45,289 --> 01:04:47,319
She's the oldest host
in the park.

761
01:04:49,790 --> 01:04:51,460
Come on, sweetheart.

762
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:53,460
Tell us what you think
of your world.

763
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:57,660
this world?

764
01:05:07,811 --> 01:05:11,082
<i>Some people choose to see
the ugliness in this world.</i>

765
01:05:13,152 --> 01:05:14,812
<i>The disarray.</i>

766
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:20,553
Morning, daddy.
You sleep well?

767
01:05:20,653 --> 01:05:22,923
Well enough.

768
01:05:23,023 --> 01:05:26,393
You heading out to do some more
of that painting of yours?

769
01:05:31,104 --> 01:05:33,204
<i>I choose to see
the beauty.</i>

770
01:06:12,848 --> 01:06:16,318
<i>To believe there is
an order to our days...</i>

771
01:06:19,889 --> 01:06:21,489
<i>A purpose.</i>

772
01:06:45,051 --> 01:06:48,081
I know things will work out
the way they're meant to.
