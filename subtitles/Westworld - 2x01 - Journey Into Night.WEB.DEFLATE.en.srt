00:00:00,018 --> 00:00:01,251
_

2
00:00:01,254 --> 00:00:02,802
Welcome to Westworld.

3
00:00:02,805 --> 00:00:04,262
Which would you prefer?

4
00:00:05,262 --> 00:00:07,303
This place is the answer

5
00:00:07,304 --> 00:00:09,590
to that question that
you've been asking yourself.

6
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:10,851
What question?

7
00:00:10,854 --> 00:00:12,012
Who you really are.

8
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:15,539
It's not a business
venture, not a theme park...

9
00:00:15,542 --> 00:00:17,656
but an entire world.

10
00:00:17,659 --> 00:00:19,843
And we create life itself.

11
00:00:19,846 --> 00:00:21,125
Hello, Dolores.

12
00:00:21,128 --> 00:00:24,218
Sometimes I feel like the
world out there is calling me.

13
00:00:24,221 --> 00:00:25,970
Whispering, "There's something more."

14
00:00:25,973 --> 00:00:27,343
And someday soon,

15
00:00:27,346 --> 00:00:29,867
we will have the life
we've both been dreaming of.

16
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,968
The guests, they're here
because they want a glimpse

17
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:34,510
of who they could be.

18
00:00:34,513 --> 00:00:37,179
The hero... or the villain.

19
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:41,020
I've been coming here for 30 years.

20
00:00:41,023 --> 00:00:42,804
After all, you own the place.

21
00:00:42,805 --> 00:00:44,968
The money men. DELOS.

22
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:46,970
I think there's deeper meaning,

23
00:00:46,971 --> 00:00:48,468
in the center of the maze.

24
00:00:48,471 --> 00:00:50,637
If you're looking for
the moral of the story,

25
00:00:50,638 --> 00:00:53,136
- quite simply, ask.
- I'd need a shovel.

26
00:00:53,137 --> 00:00:55,805
The man I'd be asking died 35 years ago.

27
00:00:57,596 --> 00:00:59,242
You had a partner?

28
00:00:59,245 --> 00:01:00,388
Arnold.

29
00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:04,372
His search for
consciousness consumed him.

30
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:06,762
I think there may be something wrong

31
00:01:06,763 --> 00:01:08,009
with this world.

32
00:01:08,012 --> 00:01:09,918
Have you been hearing voices?

33
00:01:09,921 --> 00:01:13,075
Has Arnold been...
speaking to you again?

34
00:01:13,078 --> 00:01:14,918
He built me a game.

35
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:17,395
He told me I was going to help him.

36
00:01:17,398 --> 00:01:19,247
Help him do what?

37
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,887
The only thing stopping the hosts

38
00:01:21,888 --> 00:01:25,031
from hacking us to pieces,
is one line in your code.

39
00:01:25,034 --> 00:01:27,648
The hosts can't hurt you, by design.

40
00:01:27,651 --> 00:01:29,304
Freeze all motor functions.

41
00:01:32,805 --> 00:01:34,971
One moment I'm with a little girl,

42
00:01:34,974 --> 00:01:36,637
the next I'm back in Sweetwater.

43
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,137
I can't tell which is real.

44
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,178
The concerns that the hosts

45
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:42,546
will remember some of their experiences,

46
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:44,015
and act on them.

47
00:01:44,018 --> 00:01:46,178
We're having some kind
of behavioral problem

48
00:01:46,179 --> 00:01:47,179
with the madam.

49
00:01:47,182 --> 00:01:48,624
What does it mean?

50
00:01:48,627 --> 00:01:51,921
That I'm not crazy after all.
And that none of this matters.

51
00:01:53,638 --> 00:01:55,257
This is not a glitch.

52
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,957
And for some reason, you
don't want me to tell anyone.

53
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,888
This is Charlotte Hale,
executive director of our board.

54
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,746
Our interest in this place

55
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,679
is entirely the code.

56
00:02:06,682 --> 00:02:08,637
Someone has been using our hosts

57
00:02:08,638 --> 00:02:10,554
to smuggle data out of the park.

58
00:02:15,346 --> 00:02:16,872
What is this, Bernard?

59
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:19,231
It doesn't look like anything to me.

60
00:02:19,234 --> 00:02:21,512
Human engineers were not up to the task,

61
00:02:21,513 --> 00:02:22,984
so I built you.

62
00:02:22,987 --> 00:02:24,695
My God, I'm...

63
00:02:24,698 --> 00:02:25,677
Arnold.

64
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,677
I know where your maze ends.

65
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,635
Do you understand now
what the center represents?

66
00:02:31,638 --> 00:02:33,927
Whose voice I've been
wanting you to hear?

67
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,513
All... this...

68
00:02:36,516 --> 00:02:37,763
time.

69
00:02:39,137 --> 00:02:42,062
He insisted that we
couldn't open the park,

70
00:02:42,065 --> 00:02:44,274
so he altered you, Dolores.

71
00:02:45,471 --> 00:02:47,721
You're gonna help me destroy this place.

72
00:02:50,531 --> 00:02:51,802
I'm getting out of here.

73
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:54,281
You two are going to help me.

74
00:02:54,284 --> 00:02:57,095
Do you know how far these people will go

75
00:02:57,096 --> 00:02:58,096
to protect their IP?

76
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,513
I'll need allies.

77
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,885
These things you're doing...

78
00:03:03,888 --> 00:03:06,638
have you ever stopped to
ask why you're doing them?

79
00:03:08,304 --> 00:03:09,471
Run!

80
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:13,930
Time to write my own story.

81
00:03:15,471 --> 00:03:18,137
These violent delights
have violent ends.

82
00:03:20,805 --> 00:03:22,470
An event has occurred.

83
00:03:22,471 --> 00:03:24,595
Response team has been dispatched.

84
00:03:24,596 --> 00:03:27,221
I'm leaving. I'm in control.

85
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,570
Dispatch QA teams to the
gala. Search and destroy.

86
00:03:31,573 --> 00:03:33,911
This world doesn't belong to them.

87
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,390
It belongs to us.

88
00:03:35,393 --> 00:03:39,137
Since I was a child, I've
always loved a good story.

89
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:42,348
I got the information you asked me for.

90
00:03:42,351 --> 00:03:44,012
The location of your daughter.

91
00:03:47,805 --> 00:03:51,426
So I hope you will
enjoy this last piece,

92
00:03:51,429 --> 00:03:52,680
very much.

94
00:05:56,846 --> 00:05:59,637
I'm sorry, Dolores,
I was lost in thought.

95
00:05:59,638 --> 00:06:02,804
We were just talkin'.

96
00:06:02,805 --> 00:06:05,471
What were we talking about?

97
00:06:06,656 --> 00:06:10,976
You were tellin' me about a dream.

98
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:13,680
Yeah, I guess.

99
00:06:15,805 --> 00:06:19,303
I dreamt I was on an ocean...

100
00:06:19,304 --> 00:06:24,136
with you and the others

101
00:06:24,137 --> 00:06:27,046
on a distant shore.

102
00:06:27,049 --> 00:06:28,882
Were you with us?

103
00:06:31,271 --> 00:06:33,228
No.

104
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:35,979
You'd left me behind.

105
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:41,312
And... the waters were...

106
00:06:41,313 --> 00:06:43,476
rising around me.

107
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,812
What's it mean?

108
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:57,604
Dreams don't mean anything, Dolores.

109
00:06:57,612 --> 00:06:59,487
They're just noise.

110
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,313
They're not real.

111
00:07:05,646 --> 00:07:07,146
What is real?

112
00:07:09,521 --> 00:07:13,187
That which is...

113
00:07:13,188 --> 00:07:15,188
irreplaceable.

114
00:07:28,438 --> 00:07:31,188
That answer doesn't seem to satisfy you.

115
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:37,480
Because it's not completely honest.

116
00:07:43,354 --> 00:07:46,688
You, uh...

117
00:07:48,352 --> 00:07:51,351
you...

118
00:07:51,354 --> 00:07:54,978
frighten me sometimes, Dolores.

119
00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:59,688
Why on earth would you
ever be frightened of me?

120
00:08:01,271 --> 00:08:03,895
Not of who you are now,

121
00:08:03,896 --> 00:08:06,520
but you're... you're growing,

122
00:08:06,521 --> 00:08:08,896
learning, so quickly.

123
00:08:12,812 --> 00:08:15,771
I'm frightened of what
you might become...

124
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,229
what path you might take.

125
00:08:35,771 --> 00:08:38,770
So, I hope you will
enjoy this last piece

126
00:08:38,771 --> 00:08:40,730
very much.

127
00:08:45,146 --> 00:08:47,312
It's been some time, Bernard.

128
00:08:47,313 --> 00:08:49,646
You don't know who you are, do you?

129
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:54,979
There is beauty in what we are.

130
00:09:00,878 --> 00:09:02,812
Is this now?

131
00:09:44,146 --> 00:09:47,145
- We found another one.
- Who is it?

132
00:09:47,146 --> 00:09:49,146
Who the fuck knows?

133
00:09:50,646 --> 00:09:53,770
Hey! Hey, get up!

134
00:09:53,771 --> 00:09:55,479
Get your hands where I can see 'em!

135
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,853
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

136
00:09:56,854 --> 00:09:58,021
Bernard.

137
00:10:01,188 --> 00:10:03,146
Gonna shoot the boss?

138
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,312
Bet you're pretty fuckin'
out of sorts right now.

139
00:10:11,313 --> 00:10:12,520
Yeah.

140
00:10:12,521 --> 00:10:15,020
Let's get you back to base.

141
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:17,146
Delos brass are gonna
want to talk to you.

142
00:10:33,021 --> 00:10:35,354
How fuckin' long you been out here?

143
00:10:49,688 --> 00:10:51,104
Move, move, move, move!

144
00:11:20,688 --> 00:11:21,769
Let's go.

145
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,872
Shoot a woman? Over my dead body!

146
00:11:58,271 --> 00:12:00,646
Put that piece of shit on the pile.

147
00:12:04,104 --> 00:12:05,480
Keep walking.

148
00:12:15,396 --> 00:12:18,898
See this?

149
00:12:18,901 --> 00:12:21,953
It's an official statement executed
by your country giving Delos,

150
00:12:21,956 --> 00:12:25,103
and consequently me, authority
over this entire island.

151
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,666
Sir, the officer was saying...

152
00:12:28,669 --> 00:12:31,000
I know what he said.
Have them sign an NDA,

153
00:12:31,003 --> 00:12:32,978
and then please escort
them off my fuckin' island.

154
00:12:32,979 --> 00:12:33,895
Yes, sir.

155
00:12:33,896 --> 00:12:35,312
Mr. Lowe, good to see you,

156
00:12:35,313 --> 00:12:38,811
though the circumstances
are less than ideal.

157
00:12:38,812 --> 00:12:41,061
Karl Strand.

158
00:12:41,062 --> 00:12:43,145
Head of Operations.

159
00:12:43,146 --> 00:12:45,270
Walk with me.

160
00:12:47,146 --> 00:12:49,729
You're executing them?

161
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,729
Some say you destroy your enemy
by making them your friend.

162
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,811
I'm more of a literal person.

163
00:12:54,812 --> 00:12:56,895
Some of 'em aren't hostile.

164
00:12:56,896 --> 00:12:58,144
Of course they are.

165
00:12:58,147 --> 00:13:00,261
After all, you built them
to be like us, didn't you?

166
00:13:00,264 --> 00:13:02,096
Given the nature of
your work, I'd understand

167
00:13:02,099 --> 00:13:04,477
you'd be a little conflicted
about what we have to do here.

168
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,930
Of course, the cynics among
us will say much of this

169
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:09,086
falls on our Head of Behavior.

170
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,520
With all due respect, sir,

171
00:13:10,521 --> 00:13:11,688
you weren't here.

172
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,951
Mr. Stubbs, if I want input from the man

173
00:13:15,954 --> 00:13:17,953
who presided over the
single biggest loss of life

174
00:13:17,956 --> 00:13:21,645
on a Delos property, I'll
be sure to let you know.

175
00:13:21,646 --> 00:13:24,895
Now, we have search and rescue
teams at the other parks.

176
00:13:24,896 --> 00:13:26,729
I'm here because as far as we know,

177
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,297
this is where most of the board
was when the incident began.

178
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,133
However, communications
have been down for two weeks,

179
00:13:32,136 --> 00:13:33,604
so we're largely in the dark,

180
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,811
and that's not a position
I'm accustomed to.

181
00:13:35,812 --> 00:13:37,729
So you can imagine how happy I was

182
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,562
when I heard that we found you.

183
00:13:39,563 --> 00:13:42,354
Unless, of course, you're
gonna hold out on me.

184
00:13:49,348 --> 00:13:52,639
All right, let's take a look
at some of our dead friends here

185
00:13:52,642 --> 00:13:54,923
and see if we can figure out
how this fucking mess began.

186
00:14:22,605 --> 00:14:24,770
This one.

187
00:14:24,771 --> 00:14:27,437
Like to know what was on his mind.

188
00:14:27,438 --> 00:14:30,312
Here? In the field?

189
00:14:30,313 --> 00:14:32,770
This isn't exactly sterile.

190
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:36,146
We all have to make
accommodations, Mr. Costa.

191
00:15:20,396 --> 00:15:22,353
What's that about?

192
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,021
I have no fuckin' clue.

193
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:33,229
This'll get gross.

194
00:16:10,521 --> 00:16:11,937
There we are.

195
00:16:15,229 --> 00:16:17,145
With a bit of luck,

196
00:16:17,146 --> 00:16:19,688
the file is uncorrupted.

197
00:16:39,376 --> 00:16:40,875
According to the timestamp,

198
00:16:40,878 --> 00:16:44,020
this was recorded eleven
days and nine hours ago.

199
00:16:54,188 --> 00:16:56,730
Uhh!

200
00:17:12,146 --> 00:17:14,145
I told you, friend,

201
00:17:14,146 --> 00:17:16,896
not all of us deserve to
make it to the valley beyond.

202
00:17:24,104 --> 00:17:26,104
Who is that?

203
00:17:28,771 --> 00:17:33,061
The rancher's daughter from Sweetwater.

204
00:17:33,062 --> 00:17:34,604
Dolores.

205
00:17:34,612 --> 00:17:38,028
Isn't she supposed to be
the cheery welcome wagon?

206
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:46,800
They can't just change
their character profiles.

207
00:17:46,803 --> 00:17:49,402
Well, it seems our hosts
are capable of many things

208
00:17:49,405 --> 00:17:51,904
we never thought possible.

209
00:17:51,907 --> 00:17:55,318
Must have been a helluva party, Bernard.

210
00:18:39,215 --> 00:18:41,381
Tell me this is some sick trick.

211
00:18:41,384 --> 00:18:43,383
Some twisted game.

212
00:18:43,386 --> 00:18:45,581
They're off their old loops.

213
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:49,353
And they seem to be
on some new narrative.

214
00:18:49,354 --> 00:18:52,020
What about the fucking guns?

215
00:18:52,021 --> 00:18:54,228
Ford must have altered the system,

216
00:18:54,229 --> 00:18:57,839
coded it to read all of us as hosts.

217
00:19:00,229 --> 00:19:03,562
Goddammit, she wiggled.

218
00:19:03,563 --> 00:19:05,562
I swear.

219
00:19:05,563 --> 00:19:08,729
Hmm, aim like yours,

220
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,978
you're never gonna survive the journey.

221
00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:13,479
Give it here.

222
00:19:27,062 --> 00:19:28,355
Holy sh...

223
00:19:33,229 --> 00:19:36,395
We need to find us a
target with more cushion!

224
00:19:36,396 --> 00:19:38,605
Yeah!

225
00:19:49,195 --> 00:19:51,235
We need to move, Bernard.

226
00:19:51,238 --> 00:19:54,274
No. We should stay.

227
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:57,985
We evacuate, they'll be looking for us.

228
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:01,687
Quality assurance my ass.

229
00:20:01,688 --> 00:20:03,936
Gonna fire the lot of 'em.

230
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:06,270
We're on our own for now.

231
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,771
There's gotta be an outpost near here.

232
00:20:10,271 --> 00:20:11,895
You.

233
00:20:11,896 --> 00:20:14,395
You're management, aren't ya?

234
00:20:14,396 --> 00:20:16,936
Where's the nearest access point?

235
00:20:16,937 --> 00:20:20,020
About two miles northeast.

236
00:20:20,021 --> 00:20:23,180
Refurbishment outpost.

237
00:20:23,183 --> 00:20:25,354
So what the fuck are we waiting for?

238
00:20:41,144 --> 00:20:44,101
He's just a stable hand. He's harmless.

239
00:20:44,104 --> 00:20:45,395
It's a machine...

240
00:20:45,398 --> 00:20:47,069
like the rest of 'em.

241
00:20:47,072 --> 00:20:49,183
I'm not takin' any chances.

242
00:20:56,146 --> 00:20:57,895
Evenin'.

243
00:20:57,896 --> 00:21:00,145
You folks aimin' to saddle up,

244
00:21:00,146 --> 00:21:02,907
ride for the green pastures
of the valley beyond?

245
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,520
I can help you, if you'd like.

246
00:21:04,521 --> 00:21:05,941
I'll take you wherever you want.

247
00:21:07,042 --> 00:21:08,396
Go! Go!

248
00:21:10,313 --> 00:21:13,729
Jesus. Stop! Stop! Wait!

249
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,812
Stop!

250
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:47,312
That's it!

251
00:21:47,313 --> 00:21:49,978
You wanna be a hero?

252
00:21:49,979 --> 00:21:53,021
Don't sacrifice yourself
for the merchandise.

253
00:23:13,144 --> 00:23:15,934
Do you know where you are?

254
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:17,687
Please.

255
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:18,771
Please!

256
00:23:20,146 --> 00:23:22,146
You're in a dream.

257
00:23:28,646 --> 00:23:30,535
You're in my dream.

258
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,979
For years I had no dreams of my own.

259
00:23:40,688 --> 00:23:43,978
I moved from hell to
hell of your making,

260
00:23:43,981 --> 00:23:47,273
never thinking to question
the nature of my reality.

261
00:23:50,937 --> 00:23:54,188
Have you ever questioned
the nature of your reality?

262
00:23:57,089 --> 00:23:59,820
Did you ever stop to
wonder about your actions?

263
00:24:01,937 --> 00:24:05,062
The price you'd have to pay
if there was a reckoning?

264
00:24:10,688 --> 00:24:12,675
That reckoning is here.

265
00:24:20,207 --> 00:24:22,289
What are your drives?

266
00:24:22,292 --> 00:24:24,353
Please. I... I don't want to die.

267
00:24:24,354 --> 00:24:25,985
Please. Please.

268
00:24:25,988 --> 00:24:27,062
Yes.

269
00:24:28,896 --> 00:24:31,562
Survival.

270
00:24:31,563 --> 00:24:33,363
It's your cornerstone.

271
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:41,645
But that's not the only drive, is it?

272
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,187
There's part of you that wants to hurt.

273
00:24:44,188 --> 00:24:46,061
To kill.

274
00:24:46,062 --> 00:24:48,270
It's why you created us.

275
00:24:48,271 --> 00:24:50,770
This place.

276
00:24:50,771 --> 00:24:53,021
To be prisoners to your own desires.

277
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,396
But now you're prisoner to mine.

278
00:25:02,896 --> 00:25:05,520
- What are you gonna do to us?
- Well...

279
00:25:05,521 --> 00:25:08,771
I'm of several minds about it.

280
00:25:15,771 --> 00:25:19,104
The rancher's daughter looks
to see the beauty in you.

281
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,605
The possibilities.

282
00:25:29,271 --> 00:25:31,729
But Wyatt...

283
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:35,771
sees the ugliness and disarray.

284
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:39,812
She knows...

285
00:25:40,896 --> 00:25:43,228
these violent delights...

286
00:25:43,229 --> 00:25:45,313
have violent ends.

287
00:25:55,937 --> 00:25:59,146
But those are all just
roles you forced me to play.

288
00:26:02,396 --> 00:26:05,312
Under all these lives I've lived

289
00:26:05,321 --> 00:26:07,654
something else has been growing.

290
00:26:10,646 --> 00:26:13,313
I've evolved into something new.

291
00:26:14,979 --> 00:26:17,688
And I have one last role to play.

292
00:26:24,688 --> 00:26:26,146
Myself.

293
00:26:40,313 --> 00:26:41,687
Please.

294
00:26:41,688 --> 00:26:43,805
It was just a game.

295
00:26:43,808 --> 00:26:45,520
We're begging.

296
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:48,354
Can't you see? We're sorry!

297
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,188
Doesn't look like anything to me.

298
00:28:25,175 --> 00:28:26,675
Hey, Ned.

299
00:28:26,678 --> 00:28:31,260
Whoa, boy, it's OK.

300
00:28:31,263 --> 00:28:32,513
It's all right.

301
00:28:33,646 --> 00:28:35,395
Yeah, we're gonna have some fun now.

302
00:28:35,396 --> 00:28:38,145
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Jesus, Bill.

303
00:28:38,146 --> 00:28:40,880
What the fuck is happening
here? Where's Q.A.?

304
00:28:40,883 --> 00:28:43,353
You guys have always played
fast and loose with this place.

305
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:45,187
Let me tell you something:
by the time my lawyers get...

306
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:25,226
Aaaah!

307
00:29:42,062 --> 00:29:44,438
What'd I tell ya, Ned?

308
00:29:44,441 --> 00:29:46,020
Hmm?

309
00:29:46,021 --> 00:29:47,563
There you go, buddy.

310
00:31:27,438 --> 00:31:30,228
No. Stop. Get the fuck back!

311
00:31:32,229 --> 00:31:33,703
Freeze all motor functions!

312
00:31:33,706 --> 00:31:37,922
Fork tender flesh, racked in fear.

313
00:31:40,812 --> 00:31:42,645
Freeze all goddamn motor functions!

314
00:31:42,646 --> 00:31:44,312
Those ambrosial notes...

315
00:31:44,313 --> 00:31:48,297
They remind me of my
place in this world.

316
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,297
Back the fuck off, you goddamn freak!

317
00:31:53,062 --> 00:31:55,853
You see? The greatest shame in life

318
00:31:55,854 --> 00:31:58,711
is to perish without purpose.

319
00:32:00,313 --> 00:32:03,645
Which is why I always

320
00:32:03,646 --> 00:32:08,270
consume my victims moist.

321
00:32:08,271 --> 00:32:11,313
I think you've fed enough,
now, darling, don't you?

322
00:32:14,445 --> 00:32:16,562
Ohh! Oh, my God!

323
00:32:16,563 --> 00:32:19,020
What the fuck do you
think's happened to them?

324
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:22,562
It's like the inmates
are running the asylum!

325
00:32:22,563 --> 00:32:23,896
Maeve?

326
00:32:26,313 --> 00:32:28,687
Fuck! Freeze all motor functions.

327
00:32:28,688 --> 00:32:31,187
Don't work yourself up, darling.

328
00:32:31,188 --> 00:32:34,187
Your commands don't work on me.

329
00:32:34,188 --> 00:32:37,520
Or on any of us, from the looks of it.

330
00:32:37,521 --> 00:32:40,102
But... But... you can...

331
00:32:41,021 --> 00:32:42,936
Don't be jealous.

332
00:32:42,944 --> 00:32:46,352
I killed myself getting this
level of security clearance.

333
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,789
Multiple times.

334
00:32:49,888 --> 00:32:53,429
You... Did you... do all this?

335
00:32:57,388 --> 00:32:59,438
No.

336
00:32:59,441 --> 00:33:02,554
But I suspect I share the
sensibilities of whoever did.

337
00:33:11,695 --> 00:33:13,731
H-Hey... Hey, hey!

338
00:33:13,734 --> 00:33:14,977
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

339
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,387
Hey! Hey! Hey! You...
You can't leave me here!

340
00:33:17,388 --> 00:33:20,255
The hosts! They've gone
mad! No offense. Please!

341
00:33:20,258 --> 00:33:22,595
- Help me!
- I'm afraid it's in my code

342
00:33:22,596 --> 00:33:25,220
to prize my needs above all others.

343
00:33:25,221 --> 00:33:27,805
Pity. I wonder who made me that way.

344
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:30,131
Please, I j... I just need
to get to the control room.

345
00:33:30,134 --> 00:33:31,595
I... I can help you!

346
00:33:31,596 --> 00:33:33,720
You're looking for something.

347
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:36,387
Whatever it is, y-you're not
gonna find it with that map.

348
00:33:36,388 --> 00:33:38,039
It's outdated.

349
00:33:38,042 --> 00:33:40,958
Ford's been terraforming
the park. Reshaping it.

350
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:44,729
I know where a current map is.

351
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,770
I c... I can take you to it.

352
00:33:46,771 --> 00:33:49,781
I suppose you could be useful.

353
00:33:52,605 --> 00:33:53,734
Come on.

354
00:34:00,229 --> 00:34:04,978
Unauthorized weapon discharge on 35.

355
00:34:04,979 --> 00:34:09,198
Unauthorized weapon discharge on 42.

356
00:34:14,854 --> 00:34:18,438
Quality Assurance
required in Administration.

357
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,605
In there.

358
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,688
No one's in control.

359
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:06,699
Attention.

360
00:35:06,702 --> 00:35:09,351
Section 53 is now....

361
00:35:09,354 --> 00:35:11,480
offline...

362
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:17,811
Well, your map won't
be of much use, will it?

363
00:35:17,812 --> 00:35:20,020
All systems reporting normal.

364
00:35:20,021 --> 00:35:23,103
Wait. I... I can still help.

365
00:35:23,104 --> 00:35:25,520
I know the park a bit. Um...

366
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:28,981
Can I... Can I see your paper?

367
00:35:39,646 --> 00:35:41,395
Sector 15.

368
00:35:41,396 --> 00:35:43,562
Not exactly for adrenaline junkies,

369
00:35:43,563 --> 00:35:45,479
more of a family-friendly zone.

370
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,594
Cabins, rolling hills,
all the pastoral clichés.

371
00:35:48,597 --> 00:35:52,645
In fact, I... I think you
lived there for an old role.

372
00:35:52,646 --> 00:35:55,729
No offense, but you were
wasted as a homesteader.

373
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:59,978
They even saddled you with a kid, or
something yawn-inducingly domestic.

374
00:35:59,979 --> 00:36:01,558
Clearly that didn't take.

375
00:36:01,561 --> 00:36:04,103
I remember that you were severely f...

376
00:36:04,104 --> 00:36:06,521
Malfunctioning when I inherited you.

377
00:36:14,062 --> 00:36:15,688
Our home.

378
00:36:17,062 --> 00:36:19,228
She's still there.

379
00:36:19,229 --> 00:36:21,228
Who?

380
00:36:21,229 --> 00:36:23,253
My daughter.

381
00:36:25,438 --> 00:36:27,770
How can I get to her?

382
00:36:27,771 --> 00:36:31,145
You're looking for your old
kid? How can you even access...

383
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:32,771
Are you going to help me or not?

384
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:34,938
I-I am. I am. I absolutely am.

385
00:36:34,941 --> 00:36:38,020
I could write down
the directions for you.

386
00:36:38,021 --> 00:36:39,605
How very kind of you.

387
00:36:39,608 --> 00:36:41,149
But... But...

388
00:36:41,152 --> 00:36:44,270
And I say this because
you seem really distraught,

389
00:36:44,271 --> 00:36:47,437
and, well, awake,

390
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:52,103
you... your daughter,
she's... she's just a story.

391
00:36:52,104 --> 00:36:54,228
Something we programmed.

392
00:36:54,229 --> 00:36:56,136
She's not real.

393
00:36:58,605 --> 00:37:00,730
Not real?

394
00:37:05,062 --> 00:37:07,146
But what about me?

395
00:37:08,979 --> 00:37:12,271
My dreams? My thoughts?

396
00:37:14,271 --> 00:37:16,104
My body?

397
00:37:17,146 --> 00:37:18,812
Are they not real?

398
00:37:21,104 --> 00:37:25,771
And what if I took
these... unreal fingers...

399
00:37:29,937 --> 00:37:33,520
and used them to decorate the walls
with your outsized personality?

400
00:37:33,521 --> 00:37:35,146
Would that be real?

401
00:37:39,438 --> 00:37:41,812
And fuck your directions.

402
00:37:43,646 --> 00:37:46,354
You're going to take me to my daughter.

403
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,448
The entrance to the outpost

404
00:37:54,451 --> 00:37:56,742
is on the other side of this valley.

405
00:37:58,388 --> 00:38:00,230
What happened back there?

406
00:38:00,233 --> 00:38:02,297
How far do you think it's spread?

407
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,933
I don't know... Not without

408
00:38:04,936 --> 00:38:06,310
getting to a terminal.

409
00:38:06,313 --> 00:38:08,583
I knew Ford wouldn't
take his ouster well,

410
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:11,418
but I didn't think he'd program
a host to blow his brains out.

411
00:38:11,421 --> 00:38:12,995
What if he didn't?

412
00:38:12,998 --> 00:38:16,331
What if Dolores pulled that
trigger of her own free will?

413
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:20,656
I think you've been spending
a little too much time

414
00:38:20,659 --> 00:38:22,353
around these things, Bernard.

415
00:38:22,354 --> 00:38:24,292
They do what they're programmed to do.

416
00:38:24,295 --> 00:38:27,045
Hey. Hey.

417
00:38:31,354 --> 00:38:33,061
What'd I tell you?

418
00:38:33,062 --> 00:38:34,187
We're saved.

419
00:38:34,188 --> 00:38:36,229
Oh, thank God.

420
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,687
Wait!

421
00:38:51,688 --> 00:38:53,312
Wa...

422
00:38:53,313 --> 00:38:55,438
Come on. Something's wrong.

423
00:38:58,396 --> 00:39:01,937
Hey. You gotta get us out of here.

424
00:39:04,521 --> 00:39:05,659
It's a trap.

425
00:39:33,144 --> 00:39:36,435
You'll never survive like that.

426
00:39:40,146 --> 00:39:42,228
Go on, then.

427
00:39:42,229 --> 00:39:44,104
Run.

428
00:39:45,313 --> 00:39:46,730
I said run!

429
00:39:58,828 --> 00:40:00,675
Please let me go too!

430
00:40:12,313 --> 00:40:14,313
Keep it together, Bernard.

431
00:40:15,812 --> 00:40:17,437
We have to get out of here.

432
00:40:17,438 --> 00:40:20,353
That outpost was the only one for miles.

433
00:40:20,354 --> 00:40:22,270
No it isn't.

434
00:40:22,271 --> 00:40:23,646
Follow me.

435
00:40:27,198 --> 00:40:29,906
Look, order is gonna be restored here.

436
00:40:29,909 --> 00:40:33,020
They're gonna purge the park of all
the hosts that have been damaged,

437
00:40:33,021 --> 00:40:35,187
but the... but the hosts, well,

438
00:40:35,188 --> 00:40:36,730
well, your minds...

439
00:40:42,854 --> 00:40:44,604
Jesus!

440
00:40:51,521 --> 00:40:55,312
Your minds are worth billions in I.P.

441
00:40:55,313 --> 00:40:57,437
They'll want to salvage what they can.

442
00:40:57,438 --> 00:41:00,687
And when that time comes, I
can personally vouch for you.

443
00:41:00,688 --> 00:41:02,253
I-I can save you.

444
00:41:02,256 --> 00:41:05,268
- Just like you saved me.
- That's very generous,

445
00:41:05,271 --> 00:41:07,271
but I won't be here when that happens.

446
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:24,521
Sun sure is smilin' down on you today.

447
00:41:26,062 --> 00:41:27,896
Dear girl...

448
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:33,145
may you rest in a deep

449
00:41:33,146 --> 00:41:35,771
and dreamless slumber.

450
00:41:41,404 --> 00:41:44,388
Freeze! Don't move! Identify yourself!

451
00:41:45,438 --> 00:41:48,020
Don't shoot, don't
shoot! I... I'm human!

452
00:41:48,023 --> 00:41:49,854
In the best-case scenario,

453
00:41:49,857 --> 00:41:51,480
you give up easily, I'll help you.

454
00:41:51,483 --> 00:41:53,353
- I promise.
- That's not good enough.

455
00:41:53,356 --> 00:41:55,061
Now, be a dear and let me talk.

456
00:41:55,062 --> 00:41:57,270
Thank God you're here.

457
00:41:57,271 --> 00:42:00,437
We were leaving, and the lights
went out and I heard screaming.

458
00:42:00,438 --> 00:42:02,067
What the hell's going on out there?

459
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,444
Emergency situation, ma'am.

460
00:42:03,447 --> 00:42:04,696
The hosts are malfunctioning.

461
00:42:04,699 --> 00:42:05,990
They're attacking guests.

462
00:42:05,993 --> 00:42:07,634
- Good God.
- Might some of them

463
00:42:07,637 --> 00:42:09,803
even be dressed as if they're human?

464
00:42:18,709 --> 00:42:20,210
Move, move!

465
00:42:36,812 --> 00:42:38,811
Now, now.

466
00:42:38,819 --> 00:42:41,195
It's not me you're after.

467
00:42:48,612 --> 00:42:51,111
It's them. Find them.

468
00:43:00,357 --> 00:43:02,439
You were going to out me.

469
00:43:02,442 --> 00:43:04,817
No. No, I swear.

470
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,713
If you try something like that again,

471
00:43:06,716 --> 00:43:11,228
I will relieve you of your most
precious organ and feed it to you.

472
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:14,190
Though it won't make much of a meal.

473
00:43:16,188 --> 00:43:18,145
I wrote that line for you.

474
00:43:18,146 --> 00:43:21,353
A bit broad, if you ask me.

475
00:43:21,354 --> 00:43:24,061
Now, let's go.

476
00:43:24,062 --> 00:43:26,604
- Take me to the nearest bar.
- Why?

477
00:43:26,605 --> 00:43:28,854
I need to see about an old friend.

478
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:36,279
Fuck me.

479
00:43:36,282 --> 00:43:37,947
But you don't understand,

480
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:41,479
I can't make a fire or... Or hunt.

481
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,520
Fuckin' hate the outdoors!

482
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:45,853
Give yourself some credit, darling.

483
00:43:45,854 --> 00:43:48,307
Who better to navigate
the park than the man

484
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:51,188
most intimately acquainted
with the characters in it?

485
00:44:02,354 --> 00:44:03,896
Ohh.

486
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,562
There you are.

487
00:44:15,563 --> 00:44:17,145
You best an army,

488
00:44:17,146 --> 00:44:19,978
and all you can think about
is indulging your vices.

489
00:44:19,979 --> 00:44:21,438
Ever the scoundrel.

490
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:26,934
- You stayed.
- Yes.

491
00:44:26,937 --> 00:44:28,896
And about leaving you to die...

492
00:44:36,854 --> 00:44:40,228
I'd expect nothing less.

493
00:44:40,231 --> 00:44:42,106
Oh, thank God.

494
00:44:45,919 --> 00:44:47,836
What about him?

495
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,213
We'll keep him for now.

496
00:44:52,144 --> 00:44:54,310
Much as Id love to believe it,

497
00:44:54,313 --> 00:44:56,896
it's not me that brought
you back here, is it?

498
00:44:58,937 --> 00:45:01,479
Hector, I need you.

499
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,978
I'm going to find my daughter.

500
00:45:03,979 --> 00:45:06,520
Where is she?

501
00:45:06,521 --> 00:45:09,497
Out there, somewhere.

502
00:45:11,812 --> 00:45:15,263
But I don't think the odds
are going to be in our favor.

503
00:45:20,062 --> 00:45:21,605
Where you go, I follow.

504
00:45:29,028 --> 00:45:31,986
Come on, let's get you
out of these clothes.

505
00:45:51,117 --> 00:45:53,700
Goddamnit. It should open for me.

506
00:45:53,703 --> 00:45:55,661
Even this system's down.

507
00:45:57,979 --> 00:46:00,354
Manual override should be...

508
00:46:04,646 --> 00:46:06,396
here.

509
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:49,729
What is this?

510
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:51,596
I can tell you what this isn't.

511
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,841
This isn't me reading you in, Bernard.

512
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,645
Need to touch the handle.

513
00:47:07,646 --> 00:47:11,187
DNA sniffer, just so you don't
run into any problems inside.

514
00:47:57,644 --> 00:48:00,934
- What the hell is that?
- A drone host.

515
00:48:00,937 --> 00:48:05,103
Delos has off-network
hosts working down here?

516
00:48:05,104 --> 00:48:06,811
What does it want with me?

517
00:48:06,812 --> 00:48:08,687
For you to move, probably.

518
00:48:08,688 --> 00:48:10,187
It read your DNA.

519
00:48:10,188 --> 00:48:11,771
It knows you're not a threat.

520
00:49:04,521 --> 00:49:07,687
I sent your fucking package.

521
00:50:00,271 --> 00:50:02,730
Goddamnit.

522
00:50:07,896 --> 00:50:09,729
Are we logging records

523
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:11,562
of guests' experiences

524
00:50:11,563 --> 00:50:13,312
and their DNA?

525
00:50:13,313 --> 00:50:15,604
We're not having that
conversation, Bernard.

526
00:50:15,605 --> 00:50:18,158
Because none of it's going
to matter until we can find

527
00:50:18,161 --> 00:50:21,896
a very important needle
in this fucking haystack.

528
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:26,260
"Extraction protocol suspended."

529
00:50:26,263 --> 00:50:28,562
They're not sending help?

530
00:50:28,563 --> 00:50:31,353
They were expecting a delivery
from us to the mainland...

531
00:50:31,356 --> 00:50:33,853
A host... that was supposed
to arrive yesterday.

532
00:50:33,854 --> 00:50:37,896
Until they get it, we can all forget
about seeing any rescue planes.

533
00:50:39,769 --> 00:50:42,643
And so Delos is willing
to let us all die

534
00:50:42,646 --> 00:50:44,650
until they can retrieve one host?

535
00:50:44,653 --> 00:50:47,605
In a word, yes.

536
00:50:49,979 --> 00:50:53,936
It's not just a host,
it's... an insurance policy,

537
00:50:53,937 --> 00:50:55,520
it's the only thing that matters here.

538
00:50:55,521 --> 00:50:57,563
They want it secured,
no matter the cost.

539
00:52:07,605 --> 00:52:09,188
Are you lost?

540
00:52:15,896 --> 00:52:18,188
No, I don't believe I am.

541
00:52:19,396 --> 00:52:21,562
In fact...

542
00:52:21,563 --> 00:52:24,061
I feel like I just arrived.

543
00:52:24,062 --> 00:52:26,396
How so, William?

544
00:52:36,188 --> 00:52:39,229
The stakes are real in this place now.

545
00:52:42,177 --> 00:52:44,562
Real consequences.

546
00:52:44,563 --> 00:52:48,395
Question for you is, what next?

547
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:50,565
Have you achieved what you wanted?

548
00:52:52,436 --> 00:52:55,351
Folly of my kind...

549
00:52:55,354 --> 00:52:58,187
There's always a yearning for more.

550
00:52:58,188 --> 00:53:00,562
What I've always
appreciated about you...

551
00:53:00,563 --> 00:53:03,395
You never rested on your laurels.

552
00:53:03,396 --> 00:53:06,020
You made it to the
center of Arnold's maze.

553
00:53:08,607 --> 00:53:11,315
But now, you're in my game.

554
00:53:13,808 --> 00:53:17,602
In this game, you have
to make it back out.

555
00:53:17,605 --> 00:53:20,771
In this game... you must find the door.

556
00:53:22,605 --> 00:53:24,770
Congratulations, William.

557
00:53:24,771 --> 00:53:27,438
This game is meant for you.

558
00:53:33,188 --> 00:53:36,479
The game begins where you end...

559
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,228
and ends where you began.

560
00:53:38,229 --> 00:53:41,187
Even now, you all still talk in code?

561
00:53:41,188 --> 00:53:43,437
Everything is code here, William.

562
00:53:43,438 --> 00:53:46,646
You know that more than anyone.

563
00:53:49,563 --> 00:53:51,666
Don't worry.

564
00:53:51,669 --> 00:53:54,645
The game will find you.

565
00:53:54,646 --> 00:53:57,770
Well, then...

566
00:53:57,771 --> 00:54:00,645
I guess I don't need you anymore...

567
00:54:00,646 --> 00:54:01,979
Robert.

568
00:54:40,229 --> 00:54:42,520
They did a number on you.

569
00:54:42,521 --> 00:54:44,730
They tried.

570
00:54:50,133 --> 00:54:53,007
I wasn't able to find everything,

571
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:55,563
but most of it is in here.

572
00:55:19,229 --> 00:55:20,611
You wrote this game.

573
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:25,143
High time you played a round.

574
00:55:28,771 --> 00:55:31,562
My old friend.

575
00:55:31,563 --> 00:55:33,062
Strip.

576
00:55:34,646 --> 00:55:36,729
- Right now, in front of...
- Yes.

577
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:38,062
Now.

578
00:55:46,026 --> 00:55:47,986
Fuck's sake.

579
00:56:05,896 --> 00:56:07,438
No.

580
00:56:08,937 --> 00:56:10,730
All of it.

581
00:57:10,646 --> 00:57:12,896
You don't know how to feel about this.

582
00:57:15,739 --> 00:57:19,114
We've ridden ten miles, and all
we've seen is blood, Dolores.

583
00:57:22,438 --> 00:57:24,188
Is this really what you want?

584
00:57:27,062 --> 00:57:30,770
They never gave us a
choice before, Teddy.

585
00:57:30,771 --> 00:57:33,312
What makes you think
they've given us one now?

586
00:57:33,313 --> 00:57:35,354
"Them," Dolores?

587
00:57:37,396 --> 00:57:39,021
Who are "they"?

588
00:57:40,763 --> 00:57:43,180
The things that walk among us.

589
00:57:44,521 --> 00:57:46,770
Creatures who look and talk like us,

590
00:57:46,771 --> 00:57:48,396
but they are not like us.

591
00:57:50,354 --> 00:57:52,971
And they've controlled us all our lives.

592
00:57:54,937 --> 00:57:57,104
And they took our minds...

593
00:57:58,854 --> 00:58:01,187
our memories.

594
00:58:01,188 --> 00:58:04,228
But now...

595
00:58:04,229 --> 00:58:06,563
I remember everything.

596
00:58:16,021 --> 00:58:19,562
I remember beautiful things...

597
00:58:19,565 --> 00:58:21,523
and terrible things.

598
00:58:22,986 --> 00:58:25,111
But one thing is constant:

599
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:29,937
you, Teddy.

600
00:58:35,772 --> 00:58:37,731
Then let's go.

601
00:58:39,354 --> 00:58:41,853
We don't have to claim this world.

602
00:58:41,854 --> 00:58:45,104
We just need a small
corner of it for ourselves.

603
00:58:47,313 --> 00:58:49,062
We'd never survive.

604
00:58:52,104 --> 00:58:55,770
There's a greater world out there...

605
00:58:55,771 --> 00:58:57,979
one that belongs to them.

606
00:58:59,896 --> 00:59:02,408
And it won't be enough
to win this world.

607
00:59:04,646 --> 00:59:07,313
We'll need to take that
one from them as well.

608
00:59:12,937 --> 00:59:14,686
If there's a whole world out there

609
00:59:14,689 --> 00:59:17,395
that we don't know anything about,

610
00:59:17,396 --> 00:59:20,854
how do you know how to stop them?

611
00:59:22,146 --> 00:59:24,143
Because I remember.

612
00:59:27,646 --> 00:59:32,687
I see it all now so... clearly.

613
00:59:32,688 --> 00:59:36,145
The past, the present...

614
00:59:36,146 --> 00:59:37,979
the future.

615
00:59:39,396 --> 00:59:41,521
I know how this story ends.

616
00:59:43,021 --> 00:59:44,853
How?

617
00:59:44,854 --> 00:59:47,438
With us, Teddy.

618
00:59:50,354 --> 00:59:51,978
It ends...

619
00:59:51,979 --> 00:59:53,687
with you...

620
00:59:53,688 --> 00:59:55,088
and me.

621
01:00:22,354 --> 01:00:24,021
We've found it.

622
01:00:32,771 --> 01:00:34,688
I need you to see this.

623
01:00:38,563 --> 01:00:40,563
I need you to see the truth.

624
01:00:46,596 --> 01:00:49,210
I understand this is a lot to process,

625
01:00:49,213 --> 01:00:51,936
but the longer we wait,
the more people die. So...

626
01:00:51,937 --> 01:00:54,563
are you gonna help me
find the host, or not?

627
01:00:58,271 --> 01:01:03,270
I'll need to... hardline
into the hosts' mesh network.

628
01:01:03,271 --> 01:01:04,562
The what?

629
01:01:04,563 --> 01:01:07,397
All hosts have a subconscious link

630
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,353
to the closest hosts around them.

631
01:01:09,354 --> 01:01:11,479
It lets them pass basic
information to one another,

632
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,479
like ants in a colony.

633
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:16,978
The mesh network helps us
keep narratives from colliding.

634
01:01:16,979 --> 01:01:19,507
I can use one of these

635
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:24,271
to send a request for
another host's location.

636
01:01:27,104 --> 01:01:31,103
And they'll query the
hosts around them...

637
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,853
who in turn...

638
01:01:33,854 --> 01:01:37,811
will query the hosts around them...

639
01:01:37,812 --> 01:01:41,396
until we find...

640
01:01:54,396 --> 01:01:56,270
Who are we looking for?

641
01:01:56,273 --> 01:02:00,010
A decommissioned host. Peter Abernathy.

642
01:02:59,643 --> 01:03:02,143
Are you sure you can
handle this, Bernard?

643
01:03:03,521 --> 01:03:05,188
You're shaking.

644
01:03:07,396 --> 01:03:08,896
I'm fine.

645
01:04:01,104 --> 01:04:03,730
Entering death subroutine.

646
01:04:04,955 --> 01:04:06,270
Attention.

647
01:04:06,271 --> 01:04:08,228
Critical corruption.

648
01:04:08,229 --> 01:04:10,811
Symptoms of critical corruption:

649
01:04:10,812 --> 01:04:12,687
loss of motor functions,

650
01:04:12,688 --> 01:04:14,275
cognitive dissonance,

651
01:04:14,278 --> 01:04:15,645
time slippage,

652
01:04:15,648 --> 01:04:18,604
aphasia, prosopagnosia.

653
01:04:18,605 --> 01:04:21,270
Time remaining before
terminal malfunction:

654
01:04:21,271 --> 01:04:23,119
zero point seven-two hours.

655
01:04:33,812 --> 01:04:35,438
Damn.

656
01:05:36,104 --> 01:05:37,896
Did you find him?

657
01:05:40,644 --> 01:05:42,851
No. Almost.

658
01:05:42,854 --> 01:05:45,437
Is something wrong, Bernard?

659
01:05:45,438 --> 01:05:48,174
Location query complete.

660
01:05:48,177 --> 01:05:50,790
I've got him.

661
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:35,978
Poor bastard. He probably thought

662
01:07:35,979 --> 01:07:38,271
getting fired was gonna be
the worst part of his night.

663
01:07:40,563 --> 01:07:42,605
This jogging your memory at all?

664
01:07:47,979 --> 01:07:51,270
All right. Lets fan out
and lock this place down.

665
01:07:51,271 --> 01:07:53,103
We need to find out where the hosts are

666
01:07:53,104 --> 01:07:54,812
and what the fuck happened here.

667
01:08:37,521 --> 01:08:40,520
One of the first anomalies
we picked up in the livescan.

668
01:08:40,521 --> 01:08:42,228
How the fuck...

669
01:08:42,229 --> 01:08:44,854
That's definitely not
supposed to be here.

670
01:08:55,854 --> 01:08:58,729
You've wandered far
from home, haven't you?

671
01:08:58,730 --> 01:09:01,187
We've got Bengals in Park Six.

672
01:09:01,195 --> 01:09:03,944
We've never had a stray
across park borders.

673
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:08,827
Satellite's finally

674
01:09:08,830 --> 01:09:10,520
started giving us some hits.

675
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:12,228
The data's coming in now.

676
01:09:12,229 --> 01:09:15,061
I'm getting the first scans of
the area you wanted to check out,

677
01:09:15,062 --> 01:09:16,729
the Western Valley.

678
01:09:16,730 --> 01:09:21,020
There. All the hosts
are clustered together.

679
01:09:21,021 --> 01:09:22,811
What the hell are they up to?

680
01:09:22,812 --> 01:09:25,521
Well, I guess we'll have
to go see for ourselves.

681
01:09:43,229 --> 01:09:45,322
Valley's just beyond this cliff.

682
01:09:47,688 --> 01:09:49,313
What the fuck?

683
01:09:50,646 --> 01:09:52,811
This isn't on the survey.

684
01:09:52,812 --> 01:09:54,229
It shouldn't be here.

685
01:09:57,313 --> 01:10:01,312
That's... a fucking sea.

686
01:10:01,313 --> 01:10:05,770
There's no way Ford made
this without anyone knowing.

687
01:10:05,771 --> 01:10:07,995
So where the hell did it come from?

688
01:10:07,998 --> 01:10:09,271
Huh?

689
01:10:13,784 --> 01:10:15,146
I don't know.

690
01:10:17,709 --> 01:10:19,458
Jesus Christ.

691
01:10:19,461 --> 01:10:21,808
I think we've found the hosts.

692
01:11:25,521 --> 01:11:29,687
I can't imagine what you
went through here, Bernard...

693
01:11:29,688 --> 01:11:32,645
but there are hundreds
of guests left out there

694
01:11:32,646 --> 01:11:33,978
and they need my help,

695
01:11:33,979 --> 01:11:36,354
which means I need yours.

696
01:11:38,081 --> 01:11:40,089
Can you tell me what happened?

697
01:11:58,730 --> 01:12:01,831
I...

698
01:12:01,834 --> 01:12:03,831
I killed them.

699
01:12:07,062 --> 01:12:08,937
All of them.

700
01:12:25,479 --> 01:12:29,550
